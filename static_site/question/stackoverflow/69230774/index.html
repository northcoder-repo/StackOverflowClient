    </div>
   </div>
   <div>
    <p>I'm learning java and right now testing how static blocks work. I am trying to build and run the below code, but the static blocks are not being executed. When I compile and run the same code via the command-line (I am using command prompt(Windows 10)), the static blocks are being executed.<br>
      I am assuming this is related to some option in the IDE, but as I said I'm a still learning Java and OOP.</p>
    <pre><code>package statictest;

public class StaticTest {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println(Test.i);
    }
}

class Test {
    static int i;
    static {
        i = 10;
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Can anyone help me out? An explanation of why this happens is also much appreciated.<br>
      PS:<br>
      When using NetBeans the output is 0<br>
      When using command-line the output is 10</p>
