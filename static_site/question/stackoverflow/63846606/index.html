    <p>There is a table on the html that I'm working on, and for one column I want to show up to 30 characters (because it can be very long). Below is my code but it's not working and I cannot figure out why. Any suggestion will be appreciated. Thank you in advance :)</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;span th:text="${#strings.substring(history.keyword,0,30)} + '…'"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

Instead, you should consider a simple CSS approach to truncate strings to fit into the column.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Slava Ivanov</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">11 Sep 2020 at 13:48</span></td>

     <p>For something like this to work, you need to account for those strings which may be less than your limit of 30 characters. The above approach will fail in such cases (with a Java <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26149182/how-to-fix-array-index-out-of-bounds-error"><code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code></a>).</p>
     <p>There are different ways around this. One way is to use the Thymeleaf "if/else" syntax (<code>(if) ? (then) : (else)</code>) to handle this - for example:</p>
     <pre><code>&lt;block th:with="kwd=${history.keyword}, len=${#strings.length(history.keyword)}"&gt;
    &lt;span th:text=" ( ${len &gt; 30} ) 
          ? ${#strings.substring(kwd,0,30)} + '…'
          : ${kwd}"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/block&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>The other thing I used in the above approach was <code>th:with</code> to create 2 variables: <code>kwd</code> and <code>len</code> to make the if/else statement more readable.</p>
