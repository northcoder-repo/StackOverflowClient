    <p>The usual constructor of <code>ArrayList</code> is:</p>
    <pre><code>ArrayList&lt;?&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
</code></pre>
    <p>But there is also an overloaded constructor with a parameter for its initial capacity:</p>
    <pre><code>ArrayList&lt;?&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(20);
</code></pre>
    <p>Why is it useful to create an <code>ArrayList</code> with an initial capacity when we can append to it as we please?</p>

     <p>If you know in advance what the size of the <code>ArrayList</code> is going to be, it is more efficient to specify the initial capacity. If you don't do this, the internal array will have to be repeatedly reallocated as the list grows.</p>
     <p>The larger the final list, the more time you save by avoiding the reallocations.</p>
     <p>That said, even without pre-allocation, inserting <code>n</code> elements at the back of an <code>ArrayList</code> is guaranteed to take total <code>O(n)</code> time. In other words, appending an element is an amortized constant-time operation. This is achieved by having each reallocation increase the size of the array exponentially, typically by a factor of <code>1.5</code>. With this approach, the total number of operations <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum%281.5%2a%2ak%29%20for%20k=1,log%281.5,n%29">can be shown to be <code>O(n)</code></a>.</p>

     <p>Because <code>ArrayList</code> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dynamically resizing array</a> data structure, which means it is implemented as an array with an initial (default) fixed size. When this gets filled up, the array will be extended to a double sized one. This operation is costly, so you want as few as possible.</p>
     <p>So, if you know your upper bound is 20 items, then creating the array with initial length of 20 is better than using a default of, say, 15 and then resize it to <code>15*2 = 30</code> and use only 20 while wasting the cycles for the expansion.</p>
     <p>P.S. - As AmitG says, the expansion factor is implementation specific (in this case <code>(oldCapacity * 3)/2 + 1</code>)</p>

     <p>Default size of Arraylist is <strong>10</strong>.</p>
     <pre><code>/**
 * Constructs an empty list with an initial capacity of ten.
 */
public ArrayList() {
    this(10);
}   
</code></pre>
     <p>So if you are going to add 100 or more records, you can see the overhead of memory reallocation.</p>
     <pre><code>ArrayList&lt;?&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();    
// same as  new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(10);      
</code></pre>
     <p>So if you have any idea about the number of elements which will be stored in Arraylist its better to create Arraylist with that size instead of starting with 10 and then going on increasing it.</p>

     <p>I actually wrote a <a href="http://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2013/01/manipulating-size-of-list.html" rel="noreferrer">blog post</a> on the topic 2 months ago. The article is for C#'s <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> but Java's <code>ArrayList</code> has a very similar implementation. Since <code>ArrayList</code> is implemented using a dynamic array, it increases in size on demand. So the reason for the capacity constructor is for optimisation purposes.</p>
     <p>When one of these resizings operation occurs, the ArrayList copies the contents of the array into a new array that is twice the capacity of the old one. This operation runs in <em>O(n)</em> time.</p>
     <h2>Example</h2>
     <p>Here is an example of how the <code>ArrayList</code> would increase in size:</p>
     <pre><code>10
16
25
38
58
... 17 resizes ...
198578
297868
446803
670205
1005308
</code></pre>
     <p>So the list starts with a capacity of <code>10</code>, when the 11th item is added it is increase by <code>50% + 1</code> to <code>16</code>. On the 17th item the <code>ArrayList</code> is increased again to <code>25</code> and so on. Now consider the example where we're creating a list where the desired capacity is already known as <code>1000000</code>. Creating the <code>ArrayList</code> without the size constructor will call <code>ArrayList.add</code> <code>1000000</code> times which takes <em>O(1)</em> normally or <em>O(n)</em> on resize.</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>1000000 + 16 + 25 + ... + 670205 + 1005308 = <strong>4015851 operations</strong></p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>Compare this using the constructor and then calling <code>ArrayList.add</code> which is guaranteed to run in <em>O(1)</em>.</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>1000000 + 1000000 = <strong>2000000 operations</strong></p>
     </blockquote>
     <h2>Java vs C#</h2>
     <p>Java is as above, starting at <code>10</code> and increasing each resize at <code>50% + 1</code>. C# starts at <code>4</code> and increases much more aggressively, doubling at each resize. The <code>1000000</code> adds example from above for C# uses <code>3097084</code> operations.</p>

     <p>Setting the initial size of an ArrayList, e.g. to <code>ArrayList&lt;&gt;(100)</code>, reduces the number of times the re-allocation of internal memory has to occur.</p>
     <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
     <pre><code>ArrayList example = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(3);
example.add(1); // size() == 1
example.add(2); // size() == 2, 
example.add(2); // size() == 3, example has been 'filled'
example.add(3); // size() == 4, example has been 'expanded' so that the fourth element can be added. 
</code></pre>
     <p>As you see in the above example - an <code>ArrayList</code> can be expanded if needed to be. What this doesn't show you is that the size of the Arraylist usually doubles (although note that the new size depends on your implementation). The following is quoted from <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html" rel="noreferrer">Oracle</a>:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>"Each ArrayList instance has a capacity. The capacity is the size of the array used to store the elements in the list. It is always at least as large as the list size. As elements are added to an ArrayList, its capacity grows automatically. The details of the growth policy are not specified beyond the fact that adding an element has constant amortized time cost."</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>Obviously, if you have no idea as to what kind of range you will be holding, setting the size probably won't be a good idea - however, if you do have a specific range in mind, setting an initial capacity will increase memory efficiency.</p>

     <p>ArrayList can contain many values and when doing large initial insertions you can tell ArrayList to allocate a larger storage to begin with as to not waste CPU cycles when it tries to allocate more space for the next item. Thus to allocate some space at the beginning is more effiecient.</p>

     <p>This is to avoid possible efforts for reallocation for every single object.</p>
     <pre><code>int newCapacity = (oldCapacity * 3)/2 + 1;
</code></pre>
     <p>internally <code>new Object[]</code> is created.<br>
       JVM needs effort to create <code>new Object[]</code> when you add element in the arraylist. If you don't have above code(any algo you think) for reallocation then every time when you invoke <code>arraylist.add()</code> then <code>new Object[]</code> has to be created which is pointless and we are loosing time for increasing size by 1 for each and every objects to be added. So it is better to increase size of <code>Object[]</code> with following formula.<br>
       (JSL has used forcasting formula given below for dynamically growing arraylist instead of growing by 1 every time. Because to grow it takes effort by JVM)</p>

        <td><span>I still think it is not answered: In <code>ArrayList</code> the amortized reallocation takes place in <i>any</i> case with <i>any</i> value for the initial capacity.

     <p>I think each ArrayList is created with an init capacity value of "10". So anyway, if you create an ArrayList without setting capacity within constructor it will be created with a default value.</p>

     <p>I'd say its an optimization. ArrayList without initial capacity will have ~10 empty rows and will expand when you are doing an add.</p>
     <p>To have a list with exactly the number of items you need to call <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html#trimToSize%28%29" rel="nofollow">trimToSize()</a></p>

     <p>As per my experience with <code>ArrayList</code>, giving an initial capacity is a nice way to avoid reallocation costs. But it bears a caveat. All suggestions mentioned above say that one should provide initial capacity only when a rough estimate of the number of elements is known. But when we try to give an initial capacity without any idea, the amount of memory reserved and unused will be a waste as it may never be required once the list is filled to required number of elements. What i am saying is, we can be pragmatic at the beginning while allocating capacity, and then find a smart way of knowing required minimal capacity at runtime. ArrayList provides a method called <code>ensureCapacity(int minCapacity)</code>. But then, one has find a smart way...</p>

     <p>I have tested ArrayList with and without initialCapacity and I got suprising result <br>
       When I set LOOP_NUMBER to 100,000 or less the result is that setting initialCapacity is efficient. <br></p>
     <pre><code>list1Sttop-list1Start = 14
list2Sttop-list2Start = 10
</code></pre>
     <p><br>
       But when I set LOOP_NUMBER to 1,000,000 the result changes to: <br></p>
     <pre><code>list1Stop-list1Start = 40
list2Stop-list2Start = 66
</code></pre>
     <p><br>
       Finally, I couldn't figure out how does it works?! <br>
       Sample code:</p>
     <pre><code> public static final int LOOP_NUMBER = 100000;

public static void main(String[] args) {

    long list1Start = System.currentTimeMillis();
    List&lt;Integer&gt; list1 = new ArrayList();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; LOOP_NUMBER; i++) {
        list1.add(i);
    }
    long list1Stop = System.currentTimeMillis();
    System.out.println("list1Stop-list1Start = " + String.valueOf(list1Stop - list1Start));

    long list2Start = System.currentTimeMillis();
    List&lt;Integer&gt; list2 = new ArrayList(LOOP_NUMBER);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; LOOP_NUMBER; i++) {
        list2.add(i);
    }
    long list2Stop = System.currentTimeMillis();
    System.out.println("list2Stop-list2Start = " + String.valueOf(list2Stop - list2Start));
}
</code></pre>
     <p>I have tested on windows8.1 and jdk1.7.0_80</p>

        <td><span>hi, unfortunately currentTimeMillis tolerance is of up hundred milliseconds (depending), meaning that the result is hardly reliable.
