    <p>I didn't find any lucene forums, so this was the only relevant place to ask this question. Hope for the best.</p>
    <p>These are the steps of indexing in Lucene given in our syllabus-:</p>
    <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bCJ6z.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Figure1</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nOoLj.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Figure2</a></p>
    <p>I understand the second step clearly. But I don't understand the first and third step. It's not mentioned clearly in this figure imo.</p>
    <p>Can you clear my confusion?</p>
    <p>Plus the sources that I refer don't even mention it like this, they explain it differently. I'm not sure from where this is copied from.</p>
    <p>What are we doing in first vs third step as written in that figure text?</p>
    <p>Why was indexwriter created first and not used later? Because according to my information that I've collected, you can also use indexwriter to add/remove/update indexes. So, we could just use it for the purpose. What're they doing in that figure?</p>
    <p>This information is originally written by a no-name person so I can't ask anyone.</p>

     <p>There can be more than one way to do things in Lucene. For example. the official documentation includes a <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/9_3_0/demo/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">basic demo</a> which uses an <code>IndexWriterConfig</code> instead. See <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/9_3_0/demo/src-html/org/apache/lucene/demo/IndexFiles.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">line 129</a> of the indexer demo source code.</p>

     <p>"<em>Why was indexwriter created first and not used later?</em>"</p>
     <p>It looks as if there is something left unexplained, or explained elsewhere: The final step , which can be:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>Something like <code>indexWriter.addDocument(doc);</code> to add a document to a newly created index. See line 271 of the above mentioned demo.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Something like <code>indexWriter.updateDocument([term goes here], doc);</code> to update an existing document. based on an identifier for the specific doc (the "term"). See line 277 of the above mentioned demo.</p></li>
     </ol>
     <p>Either way, now you see the document you just created being added to the index using the index writer you previously created.</p>

     <p>Give it a try. If you get stuck, you can ask a specific question - but the chances are it may have already been asked and answered here.</p>
