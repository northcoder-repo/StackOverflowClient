   <div>
    <p>I have the following JDBC input:</p>
    <pre><code>input {
  jdbc {
    id =&gt; "mypipeline"
    jdbc_driver_class =&gt; "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
    jdbc_driver_library =&gt; "/usr/share/logstash/drivers/mysql-connector-j-8.0.32.jar"
    jdbc_connection_string =&gt; "my-connection-string"
    jdbc_password =&gt; "my-user"
    jdbc_user =&gt; "my-pass"
    jdbc_fetch_size =&gt; 5000
    schedule =&gt; "*/5 * * * *"
    statement =&gt; "SELECT l.id, l.name, l.log_date FROM logs l WHERE l.created_at &gt;= :sql_last_value"
  }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>The log_date column is as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>log_date DATE NULL DEFAULT NULL,
</code></pre>
    <p>Warning; <code>created_at</code> and <code>log_date</code> are not the same column. The query that's being executed is as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>SELECT l.id, l.name, l.log_date FROM logs l WHERE l.created_at &gt;= '1970-01-01 02:00:00'
</code></pre>
    <p>which is wrong, since Istanbul does not go into DST, should be <code>'1970-01-01 03:00:00'</code> For values such as <code>1949-04-10</code> for log_date, I am receiving this error:</p>
    <pre><code>[2023-06-02T11:50:30,470][WARN ][logstash.inputs.jdbc     ][main][mypipeline] Exception when executing JDBC query {:exception=&gt;Sequel::DatabaseError, :message=&gt;"Java::OrgJodaTime::IllegalInstantException: Illegal instant due to time zone offset transition (daylight savings time 'gap'): 1949-04-10T00:00:00.000 (Europe/Istanbul)", :cause=&gt;"#&lt;Java::OrgJodaTime::IllegalInstantException: Illegal instant due to time zone offset transition (daylight savings time 'gap'): 1949-04-10T00:00:00.000 (Europe/Istanbul)&gt;"}
</code></pre>
    <p>How do I resolve this?</p>

     <p>"<em>Illegal instant due to time zone offset transition</em>" - Istanbul does not <em>currently</em> change between daylight saving time and standard time, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Turkey" rel="nofollow noreferrer">it has done in the past</a>.</p>
     <p>It is currently observing what is effectively DST year-round - and has done so since March 27th 2016, when the clocks moved forward by 1 hour from a UCT timezone offset of +2 hours to +3 hours.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>More specifically regarding the "<em>Illegal instant</em>" error: In 1949 on 10th April at midnight, the clocks moved forward by 1 hour - so the local time of <code>1949-04-10 00:00</code> never actually happened. That is why it is a "gap" value, as noted in the error message.</p>
     <p>This time zone data is captured in the IANA <a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Time Zone Database</a> (TZDB), which I assume is what your application uses, behind the scenes (e.g. if you are using Joda-Time).</p>
     <p>You can use an online tool such as <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/turkey/istanbul?year=1949" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this one</a> (and probaby others):</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sa7fz.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/76388627/Sa7fz.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
     <p><strong>WARNING</strong> - I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the data on this web site, but it does match the TZDB rule for <em>this specific example</em>, which I extracted as follows using Java (which uses TZDB data):</p>
     <pre><code> - on 1949-04-10 at 00:00
 - the clocks moved forward by 1 hr (daylight saving)
 - from TZ offset +02:00 to offset +03:00
</code></pre>
     <hr>
     <p>Regarding your comment:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>"<em>should be '1970-01-01 03:00:00'</em>"</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>For 1970, the TZDB indicates that there were no adjustments made. So, the effective offset from UTC was the one previously made in 1964:</p>
     <pre><code> - on 1964-10-01 at 00:00
 - the clocks moved back by 1 hr
 - from TZ offset +03:00 to offset +02:00
</code></pre>
     <p>And that <code>+02:00</code> is what you are (correctly) seeing in your data for that 1970 datetime.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>If you want to avoid using a datetime which falls into one of these gaps (caused by the clocks moving forward), then you can do that programmatically - for example:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Assuming Java (since you mention Joda-Time): <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/32862926/12567365">java.time discovering I'm in the daylight savings "gap"</a></li>
     </ul>
     <p>Other mainstream languages should have similar capabilities.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>Also, since you mentioned Joda, maybe you can consider using Java's <code>java.time</code> classes now (if you have a suitable version of Java), <a href="https://www.joda.org/joda-time/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">instead of using Joda-Time</a>:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>Note that from Java SE 8 onwards, users are asked to migrate to <code>java.time</code> (JSR-310) - a core part of the JDK which replaces this project.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <hr>
     <p><strong>Specific solution to the case with Logstash</strong></p>
     <p>Adding <code>jdbc_default_timezone =&gt; "GMT"</code> to Logstash configuration and altering the timezone of the host machine will make Logstash to query the database without getting this error.</p>
