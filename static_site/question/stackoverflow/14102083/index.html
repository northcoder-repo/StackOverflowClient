   <div>
    <p>This is not a question about how to compare two <code>BigDecimal</code> objects - I know that you can use <code>compareTo</code> instead of <code>equals</code> to do that, since <code>equals</code> is documented as:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Unlike compareTo, this method considers two BigDecimal objects equal only if they are equal in value and scale (thus 2.0 is not equal to 2.00 when compared by this method).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The question is: why has the <code>equals</code> been specified in this seemingly counter-intuitive manner? That is, why is it <strong>important</strong> to be able to distinguish between 2.0 and 2.00?</p>
    <p>It seems likely that there must be a reason for this, since the <code>Comparable</code> documentation, which specifies the <code>compareTo</code> method, states:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>It is strongly recommended (though not required) that natural orderings be consistent with equals</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I imagine there must be a good reason for ignoring this recommendation.</p>

     <p>Because in some situations, an indication of precision (i.e. the margin of error) may be important.</p>
     <p>For example, if you're storing measurements made by two physical sensors, perhaps one is 10x more precise than the other. It may be important to represent this fact.</p>

     <p>The general rule for <code>equals</code> is that two equal values should be substitutable for one another. That is, if performing a computation using one value gives some result, substituting an <code>equals</code> value into the same computation should give a result that <code>equals</code> the first result. This applies to objects that are values, such as <code>String</code>, <code>Integer</code>, <code>BigDecimal</code>, etc.</p>
     <p>Now consider <code>BigDecimal</code> values 2.0 and 2.00. We know they are numerically equal, and that <code>compareTo</code> on them returns 0. But <code>equals</code> returns false. Why?</p>
     <p>Here's an example where they are <em>not substitutable</em>:</p>
     <pre><code>var a = new BigDecimal("2.0");
var b = new BigDecimal("2.00");
var three = new BigDecimal(3);

a.divide(three, RoundingMode.HALF_UP)
==&gt; 0.7

b.divide(three, RoundingMode.HALF_UP)
==&gt; 0.67
</code></pre>
     <p>The results are clearly unequal, so the value of <code>a</code> is not substitutable for <code>b</code>. Therefore, <code>a.equals(b)</code> should be false.</p>

     <p>A point which has not yet been considered in any of the other answers is that <code>equals</code> is required to be consistent with <code>hashCode</code>, and the cost of a <code>hashCode</code> implementation which was required to yield the same value for 123.0 as for 123.00 (but still do a reasonable job of distinguishing different values) would be much greater than that of a hashCode implementation which was not required to do so. Under the present semantics, <code>hashCode</code> requires a multiply-by-31 and add for each 32 bits of stored value. If <code>hashCode</code> were required to be consistent among values with different precision, it would either have to compute the normalized form of any value (expensive) or else, at minimum, do something like compute the base-999999999 digital root of the value and multiply that, mod 999999999, based upon the precision. The inner loop of such a method would be:</p>
     <pre><code>temp = (temp + (mag[i] &amp; LONG_MASK) * scale_factor[i]) % 999999999;
</code></pre>
     <p>replacing a multiply-by-31 with a 64-bit modulus operation--much more expensive. If one wants a hash table which regards numerically-equivalent <code>BigDecimal</code> values as equivalent, and most keys which are sought in the table will be found, the efficient way to achieve the desired result would be to use a hash table which stores value wrappers, rather than storing values directly. To find a value in the table, start by looking for the value itself. If none is found, normalize the value and look for that. If nothing is found, create an empty wrapper and store an entry under the original and normalized forms of the number.</p>
     <p>Looking for something which isn't in the table and hasn't been searched for previously would require an expensive normalization step, but looking for something that has been searched for would be much faster. By contrast, if HashCode needed to return equivalent values for numbers which, because of differing precision, were stored totally differently, that would make all hash table operations much slower.</p>

Note that precision doesn't just affect output; I believe at least one way of performing division uses precision of the dividend to control the precision to which the result is rounded, such that 10.0/3 would 3.3, while 10.000/3 would yield 3.333.

     <p>In math, 10.0 equals 10.00. In physics 10.0m and 10.00m are arguably different (different precision), when talking about objects in an OOP, I would definitely say that they are not equal.</p>
     <p>It's also easy to think of unexpected functionality if equals ignored the scale (For instance: if a.equals(b), wouldn't you expect a.add(0.1).equals(b.add(0.1)?).</p>

     <p>The <code>compareTo</code> method knows that trailing zeros do not affect the numeric value represented by a <code>BigDecimal</code>, which is the only aspect <code>compareTo</code> cares about. By contrast, the <code>equals</code> method generally has no way of knowing what aspects of an object someone cares about, and should thus only return <code>true</code> if two objects are equivalent in <em>every</em> way that a programmer might be interested in. If <code>x.equals(y)</code> is true, it would be rather surprising for <code>x.toString().equals(y.toString())</code> to yield false.</p>
     <p>Another issue which is perhaps even more significant is that <code>BigDecimal</code> essentially combines a <code>BigInteger</code> and a scaling factor, such that if two numbers represent the same value but have different numbers of trailing zeroes, one will hold a <code>bigInteger</code> whose value is some power of ten times the other. If equality requires that the mantissa and scale both match, then the <code>hashCode()</code> for <code>BigDecimal</code> can use the hash code of <code>BigInteger</code>. If it's possible for two values to be considered "equal" even though they contain different <code>BigInteger</code> values, however, that will complicate things significantly. A <code>BigDecimal</code> type which used its own backing storage, rather than a <code>BigInteger</code>, could be implemented in a variety of ways to allow numbers to be quickly hashed in such a way that values representing the same number would compare equal (as a simple example, a version which packed nine decimal digits in each <code>long</code> value and always required that the decimal point sit between groups of nine, could compute the hash code in a way that would ignore trailing groups whose value was zero) but a <code>BigDecimal</code> that encapsulates a <code>BigInteger</code> can't do that.</p>

        <td><span>Also - I don't think that in general you should have an expectation that <code>equals</code> be consistent with <code>toString</code>. Classes are at liberty to define <code>toString</code> pretty much however they see fit. Consider an example from the JDK, <code>Set&lt;String&gt; s1 = new LinkedHashSet&lt;String&gt;(); s1.add("foo"); s1.add("bar"); Set&lt;String&gt; s2 = new LinkedHashSet&lt;String&gt;(); s2.add("bar"); s2.add("foo");</code> <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> have different string representations but compare equal.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">bacar</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">22 Jan 2013 at 10:44</span></td>

        <td><span>@bacar: Perhaps I'm over-extending .Net principles to Java. The hashed collections in .Net allow one to specify methods for equality comparison and hashing, thus effectively telling the collection what aspects of the object it should be interested in. If one had a collection type that maintained its elements in sequence, but offered <code>SequenceEquals</code> <code>GetSequenceHashCode</code>, <code>ContentEquals</code>, and <code>GetContentHashCode</code> methods, one could then store such a type into a hashed collection using reference equality, sequence equality, or order-independent content equality.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">supercat</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">22 Jan 2013 at 16:22</span></td>

        <td><span>I disagree with this statement, too. I've found, in my own experience when overriding the <code>equals()</code> method in custom objects, it's better to define equivalence on a small scale (aka, as few object attributes as possible) rather than on a big scale. The fewer attributes that contribute to equivalence, the better.

     <p>Maybe not. I propose the simple explanation that the designers of <code>BigDecimal</code> just made a bad design choice.</p>
     <ol>
      <li>A good design optimises for the common use case. The majority of the time (&gt;95%), people want to compare two quantities based on mathematical equality. For the minority of the time where you really do care about the two numbers being equal in both scale and value, there could have been an additional method for that purpose.</li>
      <li>It goes against people's expectations, and creates a trap that's very easy to fall into. A good API obeys the "principle of least surprise".</li>
      <li>It breaks the usual Java convention that <code>Comparable</code> is consistent with equality.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Interestingly, Scala's <code>BigDecimal</code> class (which is implemented using Java's <code>BigDecimal</code> under the hood) has made the opposite choice:</p>
     <pre><code>BigDecimal("2.0") == BigDecimal("2.00")     // true
</code></pre>

        <td><span>A fundamental requirement of <code>equals</code> is that two objects with unequal hash codes must compare unequal, and the design of <code>BigDecimal</code> is such that numbers with different precision are stored very differently. Thus, having <code>equals</code> regard values with different precision as equivalent would greatly impair the performance of hash tables, even those in which all values were stored with equivalent precision.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">supercat</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">25 Jul 2014 at 23:06</span></td>

        <td><span>Use of such types as map keys may not be terribly common, but it's probably not terribly rare either. Among other things, code which ends up computing similar values frequently may sometimes benefit enormously from caching frequently-computed values. For that to work efficiently, it's imperative that the hash function be good and fast.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">supercat</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">27 Jul 2014 at 04:41</span></td>
