    <p>I'm using NetBeans 12 and I hate the fact that it highlights all instances of classnames in HTML and leaves them highlighted with no apparent way to remove the highlighting until another classname/id is selected.</p>
    <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p7g9N.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/74543587/p7g9N.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
    <p>I have searched for answers, and a common one is to use Tools &gt; Options &gt; Editor &gt; Highlighting and deselect "mark occurrences of symbol under carat." I think that is for a different problem though, and for some reason the only language in the dropdown is PHP, so I can't uncheck this for HTML anyway.</p>
    <p>Please tell me how I can stop this annoying behaviour, or at least use a keyboard shortcut to remove the highlighting. I would have though something like ESC would be set up to do this as default, but no...</p>

     <p>Go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Fonts &amp; Colors</p>
     <p>There you will see a drop-down list of different style profiles. In my case, I have "FlatLaf Light" selected. Yours may be different, but that should not matter.</p>
     <p>Choose the "Syntax" sub-menu.</p>
     <p>In the "language" list choose "HTML"</p>
     <p>In the "Category" list, scroll down to "CSS embedded in HTML" and then select it.</p>
     <p>Change the "Background" color to "Inherited".</p>
     <p>Hit "Apply" to save your changes.</p>
     <p>In my case, this looks as follows:</p>
     <p>Before the change:</p>

     <p>After the change:</p>

     <p>This changes the (very specific) highlighting issue shown in your question's screenshot. But you may want to make a similar change in other places... For example, you can see the opening and closing (matching) <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tags are highlighted (which I find useful).</p>
     <p>So, you can also take a look at other languages - and even the "All Languages" option for a broader range of places where similar changes can be made (e.g "Mark Occurrences"). But I have not investigated these in any detail.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>Final notes - all subjective and based on personal preferences...</p>
     <p>You may choose to keep the highlighting feature, but to use a less intrusive color, of course, instead of completely removing it.</p>
     <p>I am using NetBeans 15 - so that may affect which overall look and feel themes you have available, also. But a different theme (retaining the highlighting) may also be another option.</p>
