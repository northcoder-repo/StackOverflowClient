    <p>I've been following the really simple instructions <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in" rel="noreferrer">here</a> ("Integrating Google Sign-In into your web app").</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;script src="https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js" async defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;meta name="google-signin-client_id" content="YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com"&gt;
&lt;div class="g-signin2" data-onsuccess="onSignIn"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>Although it does work in Chrome 83, I get warnings in the JavaScript console about third party cookies. And indeed, when my users, some of whom have third-party cookies disabled, try the Login button, it flashes a window and nothing happens.</p>
    <p>In the documentation under Troubleshooting, it says "If many of your users have this feature enabled ... another workaround is to implement server-side OAuth 2.0 flows."</p>
    <p>OK. So what do they mean by server-side OAuth 2.0 flows?</p>
    <p>(FWIW my app is a React single page app).</p>

     <p>There's general information at <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server" rel="noreferrer">https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server</a>. Here's one way to do it:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>Your app provides a link to your users to log in. This link goes to <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signin/oauth?response_type=code&amp;client_id=CLIENT_ID&amp;scope=openid%20email&amp;redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&amp;state=STATE&amp;nonce=NONCE" rel="noreferrer">https://accounts.google.com/signin/oauth?response_type=code&amp;client_id=CLIENT_ID&amp;scope=openid%20email&amp;redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&amp;state=STATE&amp;nonce=NONCE</a> where the capitalized words are:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><code>CLIENT_ID</code> - registered as part of a Google Cloud Project you own, using the Cloud Console (currently under APIs &amp; Services/OAuth Consent Screen)</li>
        <li><code>REDIRECT_URI</code> - a URI in your application that must be registered in that project</li>
        <li><code>STATE</code> - I use this to hold the eventual URI I want my user to be sent to</li>
        <li><code>NONCE</code> - to prevent replay attacks</li>
       </ul></li>
      <li>
       <p>When the user navigates to that URI, they are taken through a Google signin process. On successful signing, they are redirected to <code>REDIRECT_URI?state=STATE&amp;code=CODE</code>. <code>STATE</code> is the <code>STATE</code> you provided in the earlier link, <code>CODE</code> is an authentication code.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Your app processes the request to that <code>REDIRECT_URI</code> by making a server-side POST request to the Google OAuth token service at <a href="https://oath2.googleapis.com/token" rel="noreferrer">https://oath2.googleapis.com/token</a>, passing the <code>CODE</code>, <code>CLIENT_ID</code>, <code>CLIENT_SECRET</code> (provided in the Cloud Console when registering the application), <code>REDIRECT_URI</code>, and <code>GRANT_TYPE</code> (the string <code>authorization_code</code>).</p>
       <p>The JSON response to that request will include a field called <code>id_token</code>. That <code>id_token</code> is a JWT that includes, among other things, the user's verified email address in the <code>sub</code> field.</p>
       <p>You can then establish your own session with that user information, and set a first party cookie for it. You can verify and parse that JWT with a Google auth library or a third party library.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Respond to the <code>REDIRECT_URI</code> with a redirect response that sets your session cookie, sending the user to the appropriate part of your app.</p></li>
     </ol>
     <p>This is pretty verbose, but I did the above in a sample application I created and it worked for that. I hope it can be adapted to your needs.</p>

        <td><span>Very nice answer, thank you! I searched for details in Google's documentation and I found the following link: <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect" rel="nofollow noreferrer">developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-conne‌​ct</a> . The section about 'Server flow' allows what you want - the user authentication without third party cookies. I built a small app that uses authentication using Google endpoints and no third party cookis, and it works fine. Hope it helps.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Marcelo Gouveia</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">22 Apr 2021 at 18:24</span></td>
