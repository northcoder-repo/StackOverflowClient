    <p>I want to use <code>rqlite</code> for my sqlite database replication on a java desktop application. i have found a <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite-java" rel="nofollow noreferrer">java coding example in here</a>. But I have no idea how to add rqlite binary/library files to the project.</p>
    <p>I'm using <code>Netbeans</code> <code>Ant</code> for create the project. I used add <code>jar</code> library files to the project. But I can't find any <code>jar</code> files for <code>rqlite</code></p>
    <p>If anyone here have any experience or knowledge, please let me know how to do it</p>
    <p>thanks in advance.</p>

     <p>There are 2 parts to this. You may already have done part 1, but I mention it for clarity.</p>
     <hr>
     <p><strong>(1) The rqlite database</strong></p>
     <p>You install rqlite (the relational database) separately from your Java project - just like you would install other relational database products separately. You can get pre-built binaries <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/releases" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> (see the "Assets" section) or you can build from source.</p>
     <p>Note that the pre-built binaries are only for Linux and Mac. Otherwise, see the notes for Windows in the above link, for more details.</p>
     <p>rqlite is also available via <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/rqlite/rqlite/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Docker build</a>.</p>
     <hr>
     <p><strong>(2) Accessing your rqlite database via Java</strong></p>
     <p>Here are two approaches:</p>
     <p>(a) You can use rqlite's <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/DATA_API.md" rel="nofollow noreferrer">data API</a> using any suitable HTTP client. Java has a <a href="https://openjdk.org/groups/net/httpclient/intro.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">built-in HTTP client</a> from Java 11 onwards.</p>
     <p>There is also a <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/google-http-java-client" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Google HTTP client</a> - and probably various other similar libraries.</p>
     <p>So, with the above approach, there is no "rqlite client" JAR file.</p>
     <p>(b) Use the <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite-java" rel="nofollow noreferrer">rqlite-java</a> library you linked to in your question (I have never tried it). I see that this library uses Google's HTTP client, internally. In other words, it looks like it is a wrapper around the rqlite data API, mentioned above.</p>
     <p>There does not appear to be a pre-built JAR for this library (at least not that I was able to find) so you will need to build that yourself from the GitHub repository. You can fork (copy) the repo into a new, separate Java project to build it on your machine, using Maven (or you can download all the source code as a zip file).</p>
     <p>If you are not familiar with these GitHub &amp; Maven build processes, there are guides and tutorials to get you started.</p>
     <p>You tagged your question as a NetBeans question - so you would create a "Java with Maven" project for this.</p>
