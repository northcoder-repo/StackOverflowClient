    <p>I have a client certificate composed of two files (.crt and .key) which I wish to import to a java KeyStore to then use in a SSLContext to sent HTTP requests with Apache's HTTPClient. However, I can't seem to find a way to do this programmatically, most other questions I've found either point to external tools or aren't fit for my case.</p>
    <p>My certificate is encoded with the typical 'BEGIN CERTIFICATE' followed by a Base64 encoded string, and the key with 'BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY' and then another Base64 encoded string.</p>
    <p>This is what I got so far:</p>
    <pre><code>private static SSLContext createSSLContext(File certFile, File keyFile) throws IOException {
    try {
        PEMParser pemParser = new PEMParser(new FileReader(keyFile));
        JcaPEMKeyConverter converter = new JcaPEMKeyConverter().setProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());
        Object object = pemParser.readObject();
        KeyPair kp = converter.getKeyPair((PEMKeyPair) object);
        PrivateKey privateKey = kp.getPrivate();

        CertificateFactory certFactory = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");
        FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream(certFile);
        X509Certificate cert = (X509Certificate) certFactory.generateCertificate(stream);

        KeyStore store = KeyStore.getInstance("JKS");
        store.load(null);
        store.setCertificateEntry("certificate", cert);
        store.setKeyEntry("private-key", privateKey, "changeit".toCharArray(), new Certificate[] { cert });

        SSLContext sslContext = SSLContexts.custom()
                .loadKeyMaterial(store, "changeit".toCharArray())
                .build();
        return sslContext;
    } catch (IOException | NoSuchAlgorithmException | CertificateException | KeyStoreException | KeyManagementException | UnrecoverableKeyException e) {
        throw new IOException(e);
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Stacktrace:</p>

    <p>Sadly I keep getting an InvalidKeyException when generating the private key from the file.</p>

     <p>A PEM file of type <code>RSA PRIVATE KEY</code> is base64 not binary and more importantly is in PKCS1 format NOT PKCS8 and thus cannot be processed as a <code>PKCS8EncodedKeySpec</code>.</p>
     <p>Your choices are:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>convert the PKCS1 PEM format to PKCS8 (unencrypted) PEM format; read that and drop the header and trailer lines and decode the base64 to binary and put that in <code>PKCS8EncodedKeySpec</code> -- but you say you don't want external tools, plus it's just as easy to convert the privatekey PLUS cert (or chain) into a PKCS12 (DER) which is <em>already</em> a Java keystore and avoid the issue</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>convert the PKCS1 PEM format to PKCS8 (unencrypted) DER format, which you can just read as binary and put in <code>PKCS8EncodedKeySpec</code> -- ditto</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>if the PKCS1 PEM is unencrypted, read and decode it as above to PKCS1 DER then manually construct the PKCS8 (unencrypted) encoding, and use that</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>if the PKCS1 PEM is encrypted, which you can detect because its body contains two 822-style header lines in addition to the base64, you have to replicate OpenSSL's 'legacy' key file decryption, PLUS construct the PKCS8 (unencrypted) encoding</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>if you can use BouncyCastle specifically <code>bcpkix</code>, it can directly read and parse <em>all</em> the PEM variants used by OpenSSL for privatekeys, including decrypting the encrypted ones; however, if you're not already using it, that's an additional jar to install and/or deploy</p></li>

        <td><span>Thank you so much for this clarification, I've opted for using BouncyCastle for reading the private key and seems to be doing its job. However, I can't get the requests to go through, I get the following exception: "PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target". I've read that this means that the certificate is not trusted. The code I'm using is the same as in the question except for the few lines of code which I've changed to load the private key with BouncyCastle.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">FailedShack</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">17 Jul 2018 at 00:52</span></td>

        <td><span>That's a different question; the privatekey+cert you load in a KeyManager to authenticate yourself is completely separate from and has nothing at all to do with TrustManager validating any other party (and vice versa). But your posted code appears to use a TMF without init'ing it, and that would not work at all and throw a quite different exception than you say. Please check your code, and (if you still have a problem) add to your Q what truststore you are using for what attempted connection.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">dave_thompson_085</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">17 Jul 2018 at 11:11</span></td>

That CA certainly isn't in the Java default CA-list, and although I don't know what store (your?) python uses I'd be quite surprised if that CA is in any standard distributed CA-list without modification. Are you sure you didn't (follow some instructions or setup procedure to) add that cert to the store on your system?</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">dave_thompson_085</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">18 Jul 2018 at 20:25</span></td>
