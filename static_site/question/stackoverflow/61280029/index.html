   <div>
    <p><strong>Background:</strong> I am trying to write a simple application in Java (to run on a Win10 laptop) to read the first 256 bytes of a NFC EEPROM (ST M24SR64-Y). The NFC EEPROM is in a hardware device my company makes.</p>
    <p>That project is not going so well (I will probably be posting about that issue soon) but I am trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong in this simple application.</p>
    <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> I cannot load the nfctools library source code in NetBeans 7.4. The project name has a [unloadable] tag next to the project name in the Projects window. Right-clicking the project and selecting "Resolve Project Problems" provides the following Description:</p>
    <pre><code>Some problems were encountered while processing the POMs:
[ERROR] Unresolveable build extension: Plugin org.apache.maven.wagon:wagon-ssh:2.2 or one of its dependencies could not be resolved: The following artifacts could not be resolved: org.apache.maven.wagon:wagon-ssh:jar:2.2, org.codehaus.plexus:plexus-utils:jar:1.1: The repository system is offline but the artifact org.apache.maven.wagon:wagon-ssh:jar:2.2 is not available in the local repository. @ 
</code></pre>
    <p>I have looked for a NetBeans plugin called wagon or wagon-ssh but didn't have any luck. I also could not find anything starting with plex.</p>
    <p>I really just want to use the nfctools library but I'm getting errors and cannot find any info as to why so I'm trying to look at the source code.</p>
    <p>I would also rather be able to build the nfctools library than have to rely on an already compiled version from the nfctools-examples repo.</p>
    <p>Note: I did try NetBeans 11.3 just in case the nfctools library requires a newer version of NetBeans but I got the same error as in 7.4. I'm using NetBeans 7.4 just because my "Teach Yourself Java" book uses 7.4 and it's easier to follow the examples that way.</p>
    <p>The nfctools and nfctools-examples on my machine are clone'd from the Git repo.</p>

     <h2>Quick Fix</h2>
     <p>The project will indeed say "unloadable" when you first open the project, because you have not yet downloaded the Maven dependencies for the project.</p>
     <p>Just press F11 in NetBeans to build the project (or click on the hammer icon).</p>
     <p>This will automatically download all missing dependencies, as defined in the project's POM.</p>
     <h2>Detailed Steps</h2>
     <p>In case the above quick fix did not work - here are the steps from the start:</p>
     <p>I assume you are referring to the NFC Tools here: <a href="https://github.com/grundid/nfctools" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/grundid/nfctools</a></p>
     <p>Go to the web page and click on the green "clone or download" button.</p>
     <p>I chose "download zip" just because I did not want to clone.</p>
     <p>I am using Windows 10.</p>
     <p>(I am using Java 11 - but I assume that is less critical.)</p>
     <p>Unzip the zip file "nfctools-master.zip" (I recommend using the free 7-Zip tool to do this).</p>
     <p>I am using Apache NetBeans 11.1:</p>
     <p>In NetBeans, go to File &gt; New project &gt; choose Category: Java with Maven, and also Project: Project with Existing POM.</p>
     <p>Click on Finish.</p>
     <p>Using the "Open Project" dialog in NetBeans, navigate to the unzipped folder "nfctools-master". The entry should have the Maven "Ma" icon, instead of the plain folder icon.</p>
     <p>Click on Open project.</p>
     <p>It will say "unloadable" at this point.</p>
     <p>Hit F11 to build the project.</p>
     <p>When I do this, the build ends with the following output in the NetBeans console:</p>
     <pre><code>Reactor Summary for NFC Tools for Java 1.0-SNAPSHOT:

NFC Tools for Java ................................. SUCCESS [  1.777 s]
nfctools-api ....................................... SUCCESS [  2.736 s]
nfctools-ndef ...................................... SUCCESS [  2.691 s]
nfctools-core ...................................... SUCCESS [  3.968 s]
nfctools-p2p ....................................... SUCCESS [  2.920 s]

BUILD SUCCESS
</code></pre>
     <p>Also, take a look at the contents of the pom.xml file that comes with the project.</p>
     <p>In your new "NFC Tools for Java" project, open the Project Files folder and then open pom.xml. You will see references to one of the items you mention in your question:</p>
     <p><code>wagon-ssh</code></p>
     <p>That's all taken care of by Maven.</p>
     <h2>Tool Examples</h2>
     <p>I assume that is a similar process to the above (I have not not tried this one).</p>
     <p><a href="https://github.com/grundid/nfctools-examples" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/grundid/nfctools-examples</a></p>
     <p>Hope that helps - good luck.</p>
     <p>If you have more specific questions, after this, I recommend you create a new specific question - but check if it has already been asked &amp; answered first.</p>
     <h2>Opening from Git Clone</h2>
     <p>In NetBeans choose File &gt; Open Project.</p>
     <p>Navigate to the "nfctools" directory that was created when you ran <code>git clone https://github.com/grundid/nfctools</code>.</p>
     <p>When you select the <code>nfctools</code> directory, you will be given the option to open other required projects:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>nfctools-api</li>
      <li>nfctools-core</li>
      <li>nfctools-ndef</li>
      <li>nfctools-p2p</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Apart from that, you should see the same end result as when you used the zip file.</p>
