    <p>I have a question about how and what is the version of OpenSSl that I must install in Windows to later create certificates. Install a one version (openssl-1.0.2d-fips-2.0.10) found in SourceForge but it does not generate the files correctly. There is also the official website <a href="https://www.openssl.org" rel="noreferrer">https://www.openssl.org</a>, but I do not know how to install it and how, so that when it comes to generating the keys and .pem file, it works. Generate some environment variables that point to the folder where I unzipped the downloaded, I do not know if it is the correct way.</p>

     <p>I also wanted to create OPEN SSL for Windows 10. An easy way to do it without running into a risk of installing unknown software from 3rd party websites and risking entries of viruses, is by using the <code>openssl.exe</code> that comes inside your Git for Windows installation. In my case, I found the open SSL in the following location of Git for Windows Installation.</p>
     <p><code>C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\openssl.exe</code></p>
     <p>If you also want instructions on how to use OPENSSL to generate and use Certificates, here is a write-up on my blog. The step by step instructions first explains how to use Microsoft Windows Default Tool and also OPEN SSL and explains the difference between them.</p>

     <p>Do you have Git installed?<br>
       You can access <code>openssl</code> command from Git Bash without adding any environment variable.</p>
     <p>But, if you want to access the <code>openssl</code> command from Windows cmd, then follow me:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Find the path of the bin directory of Git. Normally it is at</li>
     </ol>
     <blockquote>
      <p>C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\</p>
     </blockquote>
     <ol start="2">
      <li>
       <p>Then add the path your environment variable (User variables -&gt; Path):</p></li>
      <li>
       <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/77YHn.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="77YHn.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p></li>
     </ol>
     <ol start="4">
      <li>Now open a new command prompt (don't use an already opened cmd, because the already opened cmd doesn't know the new environment variable).</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Now write:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p><code>openssl</code></p>
     </blockquote>

     <p>Either set the openssl present in Git as your default openssl and include that into your path in environmental variables (quick way)</p>
     <p>OR</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Install the system-specific openssl from this <a href="https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html" rel="noreferrer">link</a>.</li>
      <li>set the following variable : set OPENSSL_CONF=LOCATION_OF_SSL_INSTALL\bin\openssl.cfg</li>

       <p>Other (3<sup>rd</sup>-party) software may bundle <em>OpenSSL</em>, so it gets "installed" as a side effect.

       <p>And of course, you can build it yourself from sources, but that requires a little bit deeper knowledge (<a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/NOTES-WINDOWS.md" rel="nofollow noreferrer">[GitHub]: openssl/openssl - (master) openssl/NOTES-WINDOWS.md</a>)</p></li>

     <p>I recently needed to document how to get a version of it installed, so I've copied my steps here, as the other answers were using different sources from what I recommend, which is Cygwin. I like Cygwin because it is well maintained and provides a wealth of other utilities for Windows. Cygwin also allows you to easily update the versions as needed when vulnerabilities are fixed. <em>Please update your version of OpenSSL often!</em></p>
     <p>Open a Windows Command prompt and check to see if you have OpenSSL installed by entering: <strong>openssl version</strong></p>
     <p>If you get an error message that the command is NOT recognized, then install OpenSSL by referring to <a href="https://cygwin.com/install.html" rel="noreferrer">Cygwin</a> following the summary steps below:</p>
     <p>Basically, download and run the <a href="https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe" rel="noreferrer">Cygwin Windows Setup App</a> to install and to update as needed the OpenSSL application:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Select an install directory, such as C:\cygwin64. Choose a download mirror such as: <a href="http://mirror.cs.vt.edu" rel="noreferrer">http://mirror.cs.vt.edu</a></li>
      <li>Enter in <strong>openssl</strong> into the search and select it. You can also select/un-select other items of interest at this time. The click <strong>Next</strong> twice then click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
      <li>After installing, you need to edit the PATH variable. On Windows, you can access the System Control Center by pressing&nbsp;<strong>Windows Key</strong> + <strong>Pause</strong>. In the System window, click&nbsp;<strong>Advanced System Settings</strong> → <strong>Advanced</strong> (tab) → <strong>Environment Variables</strong>. For Windows 10, a quick access is to enter "Edit the system environment variables" in the Start Search of Windows and click the button "<strong>Environment Variables</strong>". Change the PATH variable (double-click on it or Select and&nbsp;<strong>Edit</strong>), and add the path where your Cywgwin is, e.g.&nbsp;C:\cygwin\bin.</li>
      <li>Verify you have it installed via a <em>new Command Prompt</em> window: <strong>openssl version</strong>. For example: <code>C:\Program Files\mosquitto&gt;openssl versionOpenSSL 1.1.1f 31 Mar 2020</code>
       <ul>
        <li>If not, refer to the Cygwin&nbsp;documentation and also other tutorials such as: <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/4diac/documentation/html/installation/cygwin.html" rel="noreferrer">https://www.eclipse.org/4diac/documentation/html/installation/cygwin.html</a></li>
       </ul></li>

     <p>If you are running Windows 10 1709 (build 16299) or later versions, you can use winget command below to install OpenSSL</p>
     <pre><code>winget install -e --id ShiningLight.OpenSSL
</code></pre>
     <p>Or if you have Git for Windows installed on your system, you can also find OpenSSL in Git file directory.</p>
     <pre><code>C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\openssl.exe
</code></pre>

     <p>Here's a solution that may delight those who have implemented WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). You can just use:</p>
     <p><code>wsl openssl ...whatever_args...</code></p>
     <p>The point is that many who've implemented WSL may not realize they can call upon ANY linux command (within their underlying WSL linux vm) right from the DOS or powershell command-line this way. (It's easy to fall into thinking the point of WSL is to use it to "shell into the vm", which is indeed an option, but the power to just run linux commands from Windows is a real value-add of WSL.)</p>
     <p>And to be clear, in doing the command as above, whatever file names or folders you may point to (or create) will be relative to the <strong>Windows</strong> folder from which you run the command. So doing for example, <code>openssl req</code> to create a self-signed cert, where you may name <code>-keyout selfsigned.key -out selfsigned.crt</code>, those two files will be created in the <strong>Windows</strong> folder where you ran the command.</p>
     <p>That said, there are ways this could fall down for some openssl command examples one may find, such as if they tried to use various bash-specific arguments, in which case "shelling into wsl" to run the command may well be the better choice. You could still direct things to be found or placed on the host, but I don't mean this answer to become overly-focused on such WSL aspects. I just wanted to propose it as another alternative to installing openssl.</p>

To get the IP address of the host, you could use <code>wsl ip route</code>, then use THAT ip in place of localhost.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">charlie arehart</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">22 Apr 2022 at 23:29</span></td>

     <p>Just install the latest version with a simple Installer Script :</p>
     <pre><code>if (!(Get-Command -Name Install-OpenSSL -Type ExternalScript -ErrorAction Ignore)) { Install-Script -Name Install-OpenSSL -Repository PSGallery -Scope CurrentUser }
Install-OpenSSL
</code></pre>
     <p>The script is cross-platform and If you have git's openssl, it will add that to $Env:Path. ie: It won't install another one unless you -Force it to.</p>
     <p>I hope this helps :)</p>
