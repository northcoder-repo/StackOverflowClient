     <p>Because in your second example <code>Optional.of()</code> expects an <code>X</code> and <code>new Y()</code> <em>is</em> an <code>X</code>.</p>
     <p>But, as you state, an <code>Optional&lt;Y&gt;</code> is not an <code>Optional&lt;X&gt;</code>, hence the first example doesn't work.</p>
     <p>More generally a <code>A&lt;X&gt;</code> is not a <code>A&lt;Y&gt;</code>, no matter what <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are.</p>

     <p>In java, the basic type system is so-called <em>covariant</em>. Covariance means 'any subtype of X is acceptable anywhere an X is needed'. This is likely to be not surprising to you:</p>
     <pre><code>Integer i = 5;
Number n = i;
</code></pre>
     <p>The above is perfectly fine; the compiler accepts it with no warnings or errors and it runs as you'd expect.</p>
     <p>However, the stuff in the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> <strong>do not work that way</strong>. They are invariant:</p>
     <pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; i = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
List&lt;Number&gt; n = i;
</code></pre>
     <p>The above <em>does not compile</em>. That <em>is</em> usually surprising to anybody who isn't familiar with the intricacies of generics.</p>
     <p>The reason the above doesn't compile is: Because if it <em>did</em> compile you could do evil things that break generics. Witness:</p>
     <pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; i = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
List&lt;Number&gt; n = i;
Double d = 4.5;
n.add(d);
</code></pre>
     <p>The last 2 lines cannot possibly fail, because java itself is defined so that they cannot: the <code>add()</code> method requires a <code>Number</code>, and as per java spec, all Double values are Numbers, so <code>n.add(d)</code> must necessarily compile. However, java is pass-by-reference - count the <code>new</code>. There's just one <code>new</code> here, so there is just one list. Both <code>n</code> and <code>i</code> are just references to the same list (it's like an address book - 2 address books, both with the same address on it. That means there's just the one house). So, when you add <code>d</code> to <code>n</code>, you're also adding it to <code>i</code> - but now we have a real problem on our hands, because <code>i</code> says it is a list of integers, and there's a double in there.</p>
     <p>This is <strong>why</strong> generics are invariant. Because of the fundamental nature of types.</p>
     <p>Specifically the problem with lists shows up when you attempt to add stuff to it: If you had a list that, hypothetically, had no way to add anything to it (<code>add</code> doesn't exist, nor does <code>addAll</code>), then there wouldn't be an issue here.</p>
     <p>With <code>Optional</code> it gets confusing. The problem is: Optional is like that hypothetical list - you can't change it once it is made, so there would <em>appear</em> to be no problem with treating an <code>Optional&lt;Integer&gt;</code> as an <code>Optional&lt;Number&gt;</code>, and indeed if you treat <code>Optional</code> as more of a type decoration, you'd expect the relationship between <code>Optional&lt;Number&gt;</code> and <code>Optional&lt;Integer&gt;</code> to match the relationship between <code>Number</code> and <code>Integer</code>, but <strong>that is not what Optional is, and the java generics type system cannot fix this for you</strong> - the typing system has no idea that Optional is immutable. Hence, it cannot look the other way here and won't let you treat an <code>Optional&lt;Integer&gt;</code> as an <code>Optional&lt;Number&gt;</code>. Even though your brain knows nothing will actually go wrong, javac doesn't know that. And even if it did: Imagine in some future update, <code>Optional</code> grows a <code>.set</code> method. Yeah, sure, that'd ruin the thing, but 'is immutable' is neither a property encoded in the type system nor is it considered something that de-facto is backwards incompatible. So, javac needs to operate under the assumption that <em>could</em> one day happen.</p>
     <pre><code>Optional&lt;X&gt; opX = Optional.of( new Y() ) ;
</code></pre>
     <p>So, this works because the compiler parses that as <code>Optional.&lt;X&gt;of( new Y() )</code>, and <code>new Y()</code> is an expression that is valid where an X is required.</p>
     <p>Whereas in your first snippet, you have an <code>Optional&lt;Y&gt;</code> and are asking for it to be treated as an <code>Optional&lt;X&gt;</code>, which java won't do, because generics don't work like that, <em>even though</em> with <code>Optional</code> the problem that javac is foreseeing (adding a <code>Double</code> to a <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code>) can't happen with Optional instances.</p>
     <p>It's one of the many reasons you shouldn't be using Optional at all, or at least very sparingly.</p>
     <p>Note that you can opt into covariance:</p>
     <pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; i = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
List&lt;? extends Number&gt; n = i; // this compiles just fine!
n.add(... nope ...);
</code></pre>
     <p>The above snippet now is different: The first 2 lines are fine (an expression of type <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> is valid when a <code>List&lt;? extends Number&gt;</code> is required), but you can't call <code>.add</code> on a <code>List&lt;? extends Anything&gt;</code>, at all, except with the literal <code>null</code> and only because that literal is all types at once.</p>
     <p>You can do the same thing with Optional, and there are no methods that are 'handicapped' when you do that (like the way <code>.add</code> and <code>.addAll</code> on a <code>List&lt;? extends ..&gt;</code> basically are removed, optional has no such methods - none that take a <code>T</code>, as those methods can't be used if the generics bound is <code>&lt;?&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;? extends ..&gt;</code>:</p>
     <pre><code>Optional&lt;Y&gt; optY = new Optional&lt;&gt;(new Y());
Optional&lt;? extends X&gt; optX = optY; // compiles fine
X x = optX.get(); // compiles fine.
</code></pre>
     <p>The <code>? extends X</code> doesn't feel useful, and indeed it makes no meaningful difference to what you can do when you dereference <code>optX</code>, but it tells the compiler all is fine now.</p>
