    <p>NetBeans 12.0</p>
    <p>Jdk 15</p>
    <p>I cannot launch my program, clicking the green run button doesn't do anything, and right click + run file on MainFrame gives the error "Class does not have a main method". But as you can see in the GIF below, it does have a main(String args[]).</p>
    <p>Does anyone have any idea why this happens?</p>

     <p>It may also be worth checking whether you have any other classes in your project which also have a <code>public static void main(String args[])</code> method.</p>

     <p>Here is what worked for me on Netbeans 12.3 JDK 11:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Right Click Project -&gt; Properties</li>
      <li>In the Sources Tab, click Add Folder under Source Package Folders. Choose src.</li>
      <li>Press Ok.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>It appears Netbeans re-scans the project folder, and the main class is found.</p>
