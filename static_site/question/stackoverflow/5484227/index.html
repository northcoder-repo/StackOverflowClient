     <p><a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#forName%28java.lang.String%29" rel="noreferrer"><code>Class.forName()</code></a> is not directly related to JDBC at all. It simply loads a class.</p>
     <p>Most JDBC Driver classes register themselves in their static initializers by calling <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/sql/DriverManager.html#registerDriver%28java.sql.Driver%29" rel="noreferrer"><code>registerDriver()</code></a>.</p>
     <p><code>registerDriver()</code> is the real call that you hardly ever need to call yourself (unless you write your own JDBC driver).</p>
     <p>Note that in JDBC 4 you should not need <em>either of those</em> if your JDBC driver is up-to-date, as drivers can be found using the service location mechanisms instead (i.e. simply leave out that call and open your connection as usual). See the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/sql/DriverManager.html" rel="noreferrer">documentaton of <code>DriverManager</code></a> for details:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>The DriverManager methods <code>getConnection</code> and <code>getDrivers</code> have been enhanced to support the Java Standard Edition Service Provider mechanism. JDBC 4.0 Drivers must include the file <code>META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver</code>. This file contains the name of the JDBC drivers implementation of <code>java.sql.Driver</code>. For example, to load the <code>my.sql.Driver</code> class, the <code>META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver</code> file would contain the entry:</p>
      <pre><code>my.sql.Driver
</code></pre>
      <p>Applications no longer need to explictly load JDBC drivers using <code>Class.forName()</code>. Existing programs which currently load JDBC drivers using <code>Class.forName()</code> will continue to work without modification.</p>

     <p>Never call <code>DriverManager.registerDriver()</code> method manually. The JDBC spec requires a driver to register itself when the class is loaded, and the class is loaded via <code>Class.forName()</code>. In JDBC 4 the drivers are able to be loaded automatically just by being on the class path.</p>
     <p><code>DriverManager.registerDriver()</code> manually is potentially dangerous since it actually causes the Driver to be registered twice. If your code requires you to deregister a Driver to prevent a memory leak then you would only end up deregistering it once and leave a second instance registered.</p>
