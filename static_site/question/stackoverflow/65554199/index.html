    <p>I am trying to use a library called Journey browser which uses the Java Chromium Embedded Framework. I first created a Java Maven Project with Netbeans and I edited the pom.xml to match the values on the library's guide, to add the maven dependencies. (No errors detected) I then built the project to download the maven dependency and put their default code (modified slightly) in the main class. My IDE found no errors in the code. However, when I run the project I get a "no chrome_elf in java.library.path". I think this has something to do with embedding JCEF, but I am not sure how to add this to the "java.library.path" in Netbeans.</p>
    <p>How do I fix this "chrome_elf" problem? Also, if I am able to fix this will it be an error for production if someone doesn't have "chrome_elf" installed?</p>

     <p><strong>For Windows</strong></p>
     <p>This happens because the <code>chrome_elf.dll</code> (on Windows) file cannot be found.</p>
     <p>Java is looking for this file on <code>java.library.path</code> - which (on my machine, anyway) refers to all the locations referenced by the Windows <code>%path%</code> environment variable.</p>
     <p>One way to fix this is to download one of the pre-built distributions from that GitHub page (for example the Windows one, referred to <a href="https://github.com/CodeBrig/Journey#windows-64bit-powershell" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>):</p>
     <pre><code>https://github.com/CodeBrig/Journey/releases/download/0.4.0-78-assets/jcef-distrib-windows64.zip
</code></pre>
     <p>Then unzip the resulting <code>jcef-distrib-windows64.zip</code>. In the <code>win64\bin\lib\win64</code> directory under that main directory you will find the <code>chrome_elf.dll</code> you need - and other binaries which are also needed.</p>
     <p>Add this directory to your path - either by adding it to the Windows environment variable or via <code>java -Djava.library.path=...</code>.</p>
     <p>For example, the path may be similar to this:</p>
     <pre><code>C:\your\path\to\jcef-distrib-windows64\win64\bin\lib\win64
</code></pre>
     <p>This should allow you to run the demo code provided in the <code>JourneyBrowser</code> class. A browser window should open as a result.</p>
     <p>Here is the browser:</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Paju5.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/65554199/Paju5.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
     <p>The above steps worked for me - and the only files I needed to keep from the (large) distribution download were those in the <code>jcef-distrib-windows64\win64\bin\lib\win64</code> directory. It's possible that I already have some other dependencies which may be needed - so I cannot guarantee this process will also work for you.</p>
     <p><strong>For Linux (and MacOS)</strong></p>
     <p>I have not tried this on a Linux machine. But in that case, I believe you will need to download and unzip the <code>jcef-distrib-linux64</code> release - and then point to the <code>jcef-distrib-linux64\linux64\bin\lib\linux64</code> directory, containing <code>libcef.so</code> and other libraries.</p>
     <p>Similarly for MacOS, there is a distribution which can be downloaded and unzipped.</p>
     <p><strong>Alternative</strong></p>
     <p>An alternative is to simply use the pre-built distributions provided on GitHub, using the commands provided. Obviously, in this case, you will not be creating your own customized implementation (so, no <code>JourneyBrowser</code> class).</p>
