    <p>I am using jquery datatables to display customer data. I am using serverside processing. However I am a little confused on how to use the recordsFilteredProperty. When i set it to the total count of the customers table everything shows ok, but when i scroll to page 2 there is no data which is expected. However if i change recordsFiltered to result.Count then i get showing 1 of 10 and there is only one page showing for pagination and the previous and next buttons are disabled.</p>
    <p>Here is my MVC code:</p>
    <pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>public IActionResult GetCustomers(DataTableAjaxPostModel model)
{
    var totalCount = DatabaseLogic.GetCustomersCount();
    var filteredCount = totalCount;

    string sortBy = "";
    string sortDir = "";

    if (model.order != null)
    {
        sortBy = model.columns[model.order[0].column].data;
        sortDir = model.order[0].dir.ToLower();
    }
    
    totalCount = DatabaseLogic.GetCustomersCount();

    var search = model?.search?.value == "" ? "" :  model?.search?.value;

    int startRec = model.start;
    int pageSize = model.length;

    var result = DatabaseLogic.GetCustomers(startRec, pageSize, search, sortBy, sortDir);


    return Json(new { draw = model.draw, recordsTotal = totalCount, recordsFiltered = filteredCount, data = result });
}
</code></pre>

       <td><span>That is one way. If you are performing your filtering and paging combined into one (database?) operation, then you won't know the total number of filtered records. The way I have done this is to only filter (and sort) from the database - and then take the required slice from the app server's result set, as per the paging requirements. Depending on your data volumes this may or may not be acceptable.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">andrewJames</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">8 Jan 2021 at 14:59</span></td>

    <div>
     <p>When using DataTables server-side processing, there are a few points to consider to handle paging controls and the table information summary correctly. The following describes one basic approach.</p>
     <p>By "paging controls" I am referring to the "First", Previous", "Next", "Last" and page number buttons. How these are displayed is <a href="https://datatables.net/reference/option/pagingType" rel="nofollow noreferrer">configurable</a> - but here I will assume the default <code>simple_numbers</code> option.</p>
     <p>By "table information summary" I am referring to text such as the following:</p>
     <pre><code>Showing 21 to 30 of 57 entries
</code></pre>
     <p>And the equivalent text if a filter is applied:</p>
     <pre><code>Showing 1 to 10 of 21 entries (filtered from 57 total entries) 
</code></pre>
     <p>These messages are also configurable using <a href="https://datatables.net/reference/option/language.info" rel="nofollow noreferrer">language.info</a> and <a href="https://datatables.net/reference/option/language.infoFiltered" rel="nofollow noreferrer">language.infoFiltered</a>.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>There are 4 server-side processing values which control the above behavior:</p>
     <p>In the parameters <a href="https://datatables.net/manual/server-side#Sent-parameters" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sent from DataTables</a> to the server:</p>
     <ul>
      <li><code>start</code> - the (zero-based) index of the first record to be displayed in the table.</li>
      <li><code>length</code> - the total number of records which can be displayed in one page, which is typically controlled by the length-changer drop down.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>In the parameters sent from the server to DataTables (along with our ten records to be displayed):</p>
     <ul>
      <li><code>recordsTotal</code> - the total number of records in the unfiltered data set (for example, this may be the row count of the source database table).</li>
      <li><code>recordsFiltered</code> - the number of records in the source data set, after any filters have been applied. The filters are those provided in the DataTables search input field. If there are no filters, or if the filters do not affect any rows, then this value will equal <code>recordsTotal</code>.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>So, if <code>start</code> = 20 and <code>length</code> = 10, this means we want DataTables to display rows 21 through 30 from our overall data set (i.e. page two). Therefore the server will send this specific set of ten records back to DataTables, to be displayed.</p>
     <p>And if <code>recordsTotal</code> = 123, but after filtering there are only 77 relevant records, then <code>recordsFiltered</code> = 77.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>However, in order to use the above data effectively, the server must also take into account any column ordering settings in DataTables. This information is also included in the <a href="https://datatables.net/manual/server-side#Sent-parameters" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sent parameters</a> data, using the <code>order[i][column]</code> fields.</p>
     <p>The server must therefore build a result set which is filtered and sorted as requested.</p>
     <p>The number of records in this result set is the <code>recordsFiltered</code> value.</p>
     <p>The fact that the result set is sorted, allows the server to select the correct subset of display data from the result set, as specified by the <code>start</code> and <code>length</code> values. It is this specific slice of data which is returned in the JSON response from the server to DataTables.</p>
     <p>(This is also the reason DataTables can handle millions of records, when using server-side processing: It only receives one small subset of the overall data, for each rendering/drawing.)</p>
     <hr>
     <p>This leaves one gap: What is the <code>recordsTotal</code> value? How you determine this depends on the specific server-side implementation process.</p>
     <p>One approach could be as follows:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>The server builds a SQL select statement to retrieve the sorted and filtered data.</li>
      <li>The application server layer extracts the required subset of display data.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>In this case, the application server needs to issue a second SQL statement to count the total number of unfiltered records. This gives us the <code>recordsTotal</code> value.</p>
     <p>There may be alternative implementation approaches, if the "two queries" approach is not practical. However, the above approach will ensure pagination and information features behave as expected.</p>

Even if I included it in the procedure surely slows it down when the dataset becomes large? Does this slow down actually make it worse or better? I am talking all serverside now, not client side, i understand you have to get the filter rows back for datatables, but surely two calls or one call with two querys or even an out parameter slows it down more than just once call then let linq do the rest? for example i have a query to get 5 rows then a query to count all filtered rows?</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">user14966091</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">21 Jan 2021 at 14:47</span></td>

        <td><span>Understood. If your server-side approach is to only return the 10 paginated rows from the DB that will be displayed to the user, then, yes, you have to do extra (and possibly repetitious) work to count the "total in filter" number. That is one of the trade-offs you make when you choose how to implement server-side processing. My approach has been to assume the filtering is the most expensive step - which is why in my final section of the answer I retrieve all 10,000 filtered records, even if I only display 10 (and the extra "grand total" count is a fast query).</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">andrewJames</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">21 Jan 2021 at 15:07</span></td>
