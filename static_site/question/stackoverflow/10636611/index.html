    <p>Apparently, I have completely misunderstood its semantics. I thought of something like this:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>A client downloads JavaScript code MyCode.js from <code>http://siteA</code> - <strong>the origin</strong>.</li>
     <li>The response header of MyCode.js contains <strong>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <code>http://siteB</code></strong>, which I thought meant that MyCode.js was allowed to make cross-origin references to the site B.</li>
     <li>The client triggers some functionality of MyCode.js, which in turn make requests to <code>http://siteB</code>, which should be fine, despite being cross-origin requests.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Well, I am wrong. It does not work like this at all. So, I have read <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing" rel="noreferrer">Cross-origin resource sharing</a></em> and attempted to read <em><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/" rel="noreferrer">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing in w3c recommendation</a></em>.</p>
    <p>One thing is sure - I still do not understand how I am supposed to use this header.</p>
    <p>I have full control of both site A and site B. How do I enable the JavaScript code downloaded from the site A to access resources on the site B using this header?</p>
    <p>P.S.: I do not want to utilize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP" rel="noreferrer">JSONP</a>.</p>

    <div>
     <p><em>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</em> is a <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/" rel="noreferrer">CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) header</a>.</p>
     <p>When Site A tries to fetch content from Site B, Site B can send an <em>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</em> response header to tell the browser that the content of this page is accessible to certain origins. (An <em>origin</em> is a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/19542686/710446">domain, plus a scheme and port number</a>.) By default, Site B's pages are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy" rel="noreferrer">not accessible to any other origin</a>; using the <em>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</em> header opens a door for cross-origin access by specific requesting origins.</p>
     <p>For each resource/page that Site B wants to make accessible to Site A, Site B should serve its pages with the response header:</p>
     <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://siteA.com
</code></pre>
     <p>Modern browsers will not block cross-domain requests outright. If Site A requests a page from Site B, the browser will actually fetch the requested page <em>on the network level</em> and check if the response headers list Site A as a permitted requester domain. If Site B has not indicated that Site A is allowed to access this page, the browser will trigger the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>'s <code>error</code> event and deny the response data to the requesting JavaScript code.</p>
     <h3>Non-simple requests</h3>
     <p>What happens on the network level can be <em>slightly</em> more complex than explained above. If the request is a <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/#toc-handling-a-not-so-simple-request" rel="noreferrer">"non-simple" request</a>, the browser first sends a data-less "preflight" OPTIONS request, to verify that the server will accept the request. A request is non-simple when either (or both):</p>
     <ul>
      <li>using an HTTP verb other than GET or POST (e.g. PUT, DELETE)</li>
      <li>using non-simple request headers; the only simple requests headers are:</li>
      <li><code>Accept</code></li>
      <li><code>Accept-Language</code></li>
      <li><code>Content-Language</code></li>
      <li><code>Content-Type</code> (this is only simple when its value is <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>, <code>multipart/form-data</code>, or <code>text/plain</code>)</li>
     </ul>
     <p>If the server responds to the OPTIONS preflight with appropriate response headers (<code>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</code> for non-simple headers, <code>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</code> for non-simple verbs) that match the non-simple verb and/or non-simple headers, then the browser sends the actual request.</p>
     <p>Supposing that Site A wants to send a PUT request for <code>/somePage</code>, with a non-simple <code>Content-Type</code> value of <code>application/json</code>, the browser would first send a preflight request:</p>
     <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>OPTIONS /somePage HTTP/1.1
Origin: http://siteA.com
Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT
Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type
</code></pre>
     <p>Note that <code>Access-Control-Request-Method</code> and <code>Access-Control-Request-Headers</code> are added by the browser automatically; you do not need to add them. This OPTIONS preflight gets the successful response headers:</p>
     <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://siteA.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
</code></pre>
     <p>When sending the actual request (after preflight is done), the behavior is identical to how a simple request is handled. In other words, a non-simple request whose preflight is successful is treated the same as a simple request (i.e., the server must still send <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> again for the actual response).</p>
     <p>The browsers sends the actual request:</p>
     <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>PUT /somePage HTTP/1.1
Origin: http://siteA.com
Content-Type: application/json

{ "myRequestContent": "JSON is so great" }
</code></pre>
     <p>And the server sends back an <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code>, just as it would for a simple request:</p>
     <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://siteA.com
</code></pre>
     <p>See <em><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/13400954/710446">Understanding XMLHttpRequest over CORS</a></em> for a little more information about non-simple requests.</p>

     <p>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing - <code>CORS</code> (A.K.A. Cross-Domain AJAX request) is an issue that most web developers might encounter, according to Same-Origin-Policy, browsers restrict client JavaScript in a security sandbox, usually JS cannot directly communicate with a remote server from a different domain. In the past developers created many tricky ways to achieve Cross-Domain resource request, most commonly using ways are:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Use Flash/Silverlight or server side as a "proxy" to communicate with remote.</li>
      <li>JSON With Padding (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP" rel="noreferrer">JSONP</a>).</li>
      <li>Embeds remote server in an iframe and communicate through fragment or window.name, refer <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-crossdomaincomm/#N10120" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Those tricky ways have more or less some issues, for example JSONP might result in security hole if developers simply "eval" it, and #3 above, although it works, both domains should build strict contract between each other, it neither flexible nor elegant IMHO:)</p>
     <p>W3C had introduced Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) as a standard solution to provide a safe, flexible and a recommended standard way to solve this issue.</p>
     <p><strong>The Mechanism</strong></p>
     <p>From a high level we can simply deem CORS as a contract between client AJAX call from domain A and a page hosted on domain B, a typical Cross-Origin request/response would be:</p>
     <p><strong>DomainA AJAX request headers</strong></p>
     <pre><code>Host DomainB.com
User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Accept text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8,application/json
Accept-Language en-us;
Accept-Encoding gzip, deflate
Keep-Alive 115
Origin http://DomainA.com 
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>DomainB response headers</strong></p>
     <pre><code>Cache-Control private
Content-Type application/json; charset=utf-8
Access-Control-Allow-Origin DomainA.com
Content-Length 87
Proxy-Connection Keep-Alive
Connection Keep-Alive
</code></pre>
     <p>The blue parts I marked above were the kernal facts, "Origin" request header "indicates where the cross-origin request or preflight request originates from", the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" response header indicates this page allows remote request from DomainA (if the value is * indicate allows remote requests from any domain).</p>
     <p>As I mentioned above, W3 recommended browser to implement a "<strong>preflight request</strong>" before submiting the actually Cross-Origin HTTP request, in a nutshell it is an HTTP <code>OPTIONS</code> request:</p>
     <pre><code>OPTIONS DomainB.com/foo.aspx HTTP/1.1
</code></pre>
     <p>If foo.aspx supports OPTIONS HTTP verb, it might return response like below:</p>
     <pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 01 Mar 2011 15:38:19 GMT
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://DomainA.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS, HEAD
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Requested-With
Access-Control-Max-Age: 1728000
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Type: application/json
</code></pre>
     <p>Only if the response contains "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" AND its value is "*" or contain the domain who submitted the CORS request, by satisfying this mandtory condition browser will submit the actual Cross-Domain request, and cache the result in "<strong>Preflight-Result-Cache</strong>".</p>

     <p>According to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> Mozilla Developer Network article,</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>A resource makes a <strong>cross-origin HTTP request</strong> when it requests a resource from a different domain, or port than the one which the first resource itself serves.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zn3sT.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="zn3sT.png" alt="Enter image description here"></a></p>
     <p>An <strong>HTML page</strong> served from <code>http://domain-a.com</code> makes an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> src request for <code>http://domain-b.com/image.jpg</code>. Many pages on the web today load resources like <strong>CSS style sheets</strong>, <strong>images</strong> and <strong>scripts</strong> from separate domains (thus it should be cool).</p>
     <h3>Same-Origin Policy</h3>
     <p>For security reasons, browsers restrict <strong>cross-origin HTTP</strong> requests <strong>initiated from within scripts</strong>. For example, <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> and <code>Fetch</code> follow the <strong>same-origin policy</strong>. So, a web application using <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> or <code>Fetch</code> could only make <strong>HTTP requests</strong> to <strong>its own domain</strong>.</p>
     <h3>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</h3>
     <p>To improve web applications, developers asked browser vendors to allow cross-domain requests.</p>
     <p>The <strong>Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)</strong> mechanism gives web servers <strong>cross-domain access controls</strong>, which enable secure cross-domain data transfers. Modern browsers use CORS in an API container - such as <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> or <code>fetch</code> - to mitigate risks of cross-origin HTTP requests.</p>
     <h3>How CORS works (<em>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</em> header)</h3>
     <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>The CORS standard describes new HTTP headers which provide browsers and servers a way to request remote URLs only when they have permission.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <blockquote>
      <p>Although some validation and authorization can be performed by the server, <strong>it is generally the browser's responsibility</strong> to support these headers and honor the restrictions they impose.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <h3>Example</h3>
     <ol>
      <li>The browser sends the <code>OPTIONS</code> request with an <code>Origin HTTP</code> header.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>The value of this header is the domain that served the parent page. When a page from <code>http://www.example.com</code> attempts to access a user's data in <code>service.example.com</code>, the following request header would be sent to <code>service.example.com</code>:</p>
     <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Origin: http://www.example.com
</code></pre>
     <ol start="2">
      <li>The server at <code>service.example.com</code> may respond with:</li>
     </ol>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>An <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> (ACAO) header in its response indicating which origin sites are allowed. For example:</p>
       <p><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.example.com</code></p></li>
      <li>
       <p>An error page if the server does not allow the cross-origin request</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>An <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> (ACAO) header with a wildcard that allows all domains:</p>
       <p><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code></p></li>

     <p>Whenever I start thinking about CORS, my intuition about which site hosts the headers is incorrect, just as you described in your question. For me, it helps to think about the purpose of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy" rel="noreferrer">same-origin policy</a>.</p>
     <p>The purpose of the same-origin policy is to protect you from malicious JavaScript on siteA.com accessing private information you've chosen to share only with siteB.com. Without the same-origin policy, JavaScript written by the authors of siteA.com could have your browser make requests to siteB.com, using your authentication cookies for siteB.com. In this way, siteA.com could steal the secret information you share with siteB.com.</p>
     <p>Sometimes you need to work cross domain, which is where CORS comes in. CORS relaxes the same-origin policy for siteB.com, using the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header to list other domains (siteA.com) that are trusted to run JavaScript that can interact with siteB.com.</p>
     <p>To understand which domain should serve the CORS headers, consider this. You visit <em>malicious.com</em>, which contains some JavaScript that tries to make a cross domain request to <em>mybank.com</em>. It should be up to <em>mybank.com</em>, not <em>malicious.com</em>, to decide whether or not it sets CORS headers that relax the same-origin policy, allowing the JavaScript from <em>malicious.com</em> to interact with it. If <em>malicous.com</em> could set its own CORS headers allowing its own JavaScript access to <em>mybank.com</em>, this would completely nullify the same-origin policy.</p>
     <p>I think the reason for my bad intuition is the point of view I have when developing a site. It's <strong>my</strong> site, with all <strong>my</strong> JavaScript. Therefore, it isn't doing anything malicious, and it should be up to <strong>me</strong> to specify which other sites <strong>my</strong> JavaScript can interact with. When in fact I should be thinking: Which <strong>other</strong> sites' JavaScript are trying to interact with my site and should I use CORS to allow them?</p>

     <p>From my own experience, it's hard to find a simple explanation why CORS is even a concern.</p>
     <p>Once you understand why it's there, the headers and discussion becomes a lot clearer. I'll give it a shot in a few lines.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>It's all about cookies. Cookies are stored on a client by their domain.</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>An example story: On your computer, there's a cookie for <code>yourbank.com</code>. Maybe your session is in there.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p><strong>Key point:</strong> When a client makes a request to the server, it will send the cookies stored under the domain for that request.</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>You're logged in on your browser to <code>yourbank.com</code>. You request to see all your accounts, and cookies are sent for <code>yourbank.com</code>. <code>yourbank.com</code> receives the pile of cookies and sends back its response (your accounts).</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>If another client makes a <em>cross origin</em> request to a server, those cookies are sent along, just as before. Ruh roh.</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>You browse to <code>malicious.com</code>. Malicious makes a bunch of requests to different banks, including <code>yourbank.com</code>.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>Since the cookies are validated as expected, the server will authorize the response.</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>Those cookies get gathered up and sent along - and now, <code>malicious.com</code> has a response from <code>yourbank</code>.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>Yikes.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>So now, a few questions and answers become apparent:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>"Why don't we just block the browser from doing that?" Yep. That's CORS.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>"How do we get around it?" Have the server tell the request that CORS is OK.</p></li>

     <p><em>1. A client downloads javascript code MyCode.js from <a href="http://siteA" rel="noreferrer">http://siteA</a> - the origin.</em></p>
     <p>The code that does the downloading - your html script tag or xhr from javascript or whatever - came from, let's say, <a href="http://siteZ" rel="noreferrer">http://siteZ</a>. And, when the browser requests MyCode.js, it sends an Origin: header saying "Origin: <a href="http://siteZ" rel="noreferrer">http://siteZ</a>", because it can see that you're requesting to siteA and siteZ != siteA. (You cannot stop or interfere with this.)</p>
     <p><em>2. The response header of MyCode.js contains Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <a href="http://siteB" rel="noreferrer">http://siteB</a>, which I thought meant that MyCode.js was allowed to make cross-origin references to the site B.</em></p>
     <p>no. It means, Only siteB is allowed to do this request. So your request for MyCode.js from siteZ gets an error instead, and the browser typically gives you nothing. But if you make your server return A-C-A-O: siteZ instead, you'll get MyCode.js . Or if it sends '*', that'll work, that'll let everybody in. Or if the server always sends the string from the Origin: header... but... for security, if you're afraid of hackers, your server should only allow origins on a shortlist, that are allowed to make those requests.</p>
     <p>Then, MyCode.js comes from siteA. When it makes requests to siteB, they are all cross-origin, the browser sends Origin: siteA, and siteB has to take the siteA, recognize it's on the short list of allowed requesters, and send back A-C-A-O: siteA. Only then will the browser let your script get the result of those requests.</p>

     <p>I worked with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Express.js" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Express.js</a> 4, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Node.js</a> 7.4 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Angular</a>, and I had the same problem. This helped me:</p>
     <p>a) server side: in file <em>app.js</em> I add headers to all responses, like:</p>
     <pre><code>app.use(function(req, res, next) {
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', req.headers.origin);
    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
    next();
});
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>This must be before all routes</strong>.</p>
     <p>I saw a lot of added this headers:</p>
     <pre><code>res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers","*");
res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', true);
res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET,PUT,POST,DELETE');
</code></pre>
     <p>But I donâ€™t need that,</p>
     <p>b) client side: in sending by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ajax</a>, you need to add <em>"withCredentials: true,"</em> like:</p>
     <pre><code>$http({
     method: 'POST',
     url: 'url',
     withCredentials: true,
     data : {}
   }).then(function(response){
       // Code
   }, function (response) {
       // Code
});

     <p>In Python, I have been using the <a href="https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>Flask-CORS</em> library</a> with great success. It makes dealing with CORS super easy and painless. I added some code from the library's documentation below.</p>
     <p>Installing:</p>
     <pre><code>pip install -U flask-cors
</code></pre>
     <p>Simple example that allows CORS for all domains on all routes:</p>
     <pre><code>from flask import Flask
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

@app.route("/")
def helloWorld():
  return "Hello, cross-origin-world!"
</code></pre>
     <p>For more specific examples, see the documentation. I have used the simple example above to get around the CORS issue in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_(mobile_app_framework)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ionic</a> application I am building that has to access a separate flask server.</p>

     <h3>Nginx and Apache</h3>
     <p>As an addition to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/10636765/860099">apsiller's answer</a>, I would like to add a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing#How_CORS_works" rel="nofollow noreferrer">wiki graph</a> which shows when a request is simple or not (and OPTIONS pre-flight request is send or not)</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BTFel.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="BTFel.png" alt="Enter image description here"></a></p>
     <p>For a simple request (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_linking" rel="nofollow noreferrer">hotlinking images</a>), you don't need to change your server configuration files, but you can add headers in the application (hosted on the server, e.g., in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PHP</a>) like Melvin Guerrero mentions in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/41723271/860099">his answer</a> - but <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/46917668/860099">remember</a>: if you add full CORS headers in your server (configuration) and at same time you allow simple CORS in the application (e.g., PHP), this will not work at all.</p>
     <p>And here are configurations for two popular servers:</p>
     <ul>

    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' 'true' always;

     <p>Most CORS issues are because you are trying to request via client side ajax from a react, angular, jquery apps that are frontend basic libs.</p>
     <p>You must request from a backend application.</p>
     <p>You are trying to request from a frontend API, but the API you are trying to consume is expecting this request to be made from a backend application and it will never accept client side requests.</p>
