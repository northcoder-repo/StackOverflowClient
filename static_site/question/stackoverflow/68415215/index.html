   <div>
    <p>I'm still getting my head around Apps Script and just need some help editing an array.</p>
    <p>So I have two arrays:</p>
    <p><code>var arrayBig = SpreadsheetApp.getSheetByName('Big').getDataRange().getValues();</code></p>
    <p><code>var arraySmall = SpreadsheetApp.getSheetByName('Small').getDataRange().getValues();</code></p>
    <p>And I want to replace specific rows in <code>arrayBig</code> based on values in <code>arraySmall</code>, and then write that array back to my spreadsheet (the last part I'm ok with).</p>
    <p>The two arrays have the same number of columns, but <code>arraySmall</code> has fewer rows.</p>
    <p>The rows to replace:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Based on the numeric value in Column 1 in <code>arraySmall</code> replace that row in <code>arrayBig</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So if the value in Column 1 = 3 replace row number 3 in <code>arrayBig</code> with the contents of the row from <code>arraySmall</code> where Column 1 = 3.</p>
    <p>I think the answer has to do with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map" rel="nofollow noreferrer">map method</a> but I don't understand it. Just some pointers to get me started would be much appreciated, thank you.</p>

    <div>
     <p>Here is one "get you started" approach:</p>
     <p>You describe your data, but you do not provide any concrete samples - so here is my starting data, making some assumptions based on the information in the question:</p>
     <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var arrayBig = [ [1, "A", "B"], [2, "C", "D"], [3, "E", "F"], [4, "G", "H"] ];
var arraySmall  = [ [1, "P", "Q"], [3, "Y", "Z"] ];
</code></pre>
     <p>With the above data, the expected outcome is the following, where rows 1 and 3 are replaced:</p>
     <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>[ [1, "P", "Q"], [2, "C", "D"], [3, "Y", "Z"], [4, "G", "H"] ];
</code></pre>
     <p>Here is the approach:</p>
     <p></p>
     <div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">
      <div class="snippet-code">
       <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var arrayBig = [ [1, "A", "B"], [2, "C", "D"], [3, "E", "F"], [4, "G", "H"] ];
var arraySmall  = [ [1, "P", "Q"], [3, "Y", "Z"] ];

var mapper = new Map();
arraySmall.forEach((row) =&gt; { 
  mapper.set(row[0], row);
} );

newArrayBig = [];
arrayBig.forEach((row) =&gt; { 
  if ( mapper.has( row[0] ) ) {
    newArrayBig.push( mapper.get( row[0] ) );
  } else {
    newArrayBig.push( row );
  }
} );

console.log( newArrayBig );</code></pre>
      </div>
     </div>
     <p></p>
     <p>This assumes you have an iron-clad guarantee that there are never more rows of data in <code>arraySmall</code> than there are in <code>arrayBig</code>. You can (and should) add some logic to test for that, for more robust code.</p>
     <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
     <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Map</code></a> object (not the <code>map()</code> method) is central to this approach. This object provides a lookup structure: an index value, pointing to a data value:</p>
     <pre><code>var mapper = new Map();
arraySmall.forEach((row) =&gt; { 
  mapper.set(row[0], row);
} );
</code></pre>
     <p>In our case, the index is the number in the first cell of each <code>arraySmall</code> row. And the value it points to is the complete data array for that row, for example:</p>
     <pre><code>1 -&gt; [1, "P", "Q"]
3 -&gt; [3, "Y", "Z"]
</code></pre>
     <p>We can now use this lookup data as we iterate through each row of our <code>arrayBig</code> data:</p>
     <pre><code>arrayBig.forEach((row) =&gt; { ... } );
</code></pre>
     <p>The logic inside this <code>forEach</code> iterator basically says: <em>If the map contains an array using the same number as the current <code>arrayBig</code> row, then use the <code>arraysmall</code> data. Otherwise, use the <code>arrayBig</code> data.</em></p>
     <p>The <code>newArrayBig.push()</code> method adds that array to our results array.</p>
     <p>You can then write this back to your spreadsheet, as needed.</p>

I like that it's basically an Apps Script version of an index(match) formula (or vlookup). So the arraySmall doesn't have to be sequential, for instance <code>var arraySmall = [ [3, "Y", "Z"], [1, "P", "Q"] ];</code> also works fine. I don't quite understand Map() and Map().set(key, value) I mean I can see what happens, I just don't get them exactly.

A phone directory is a type of map: It lets you use a key (a person's name) to quickly find a value (their phone number). When you use <code>set()</code> you are adding an entry to the phone directory (or replacing the existing entry): <code>myDirectory.set('Smith', '123-45-67')</code>. And when you use <code>myDirectory.get('Smith')</code>, you retrieve the phone number. This retrieval is efficient/fast, compared to searching an array.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">andrewJames</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">17 Jul 2021 at 13:39</span></td>

And to be clear one match value is a number the other is text. Or is a completely different approach required?

        <td><span>You can use the same approach - but when you use <code>mapper.set(key, value);</code>, the key can no longer be <code>row[0]</code>. It has to be a combination of <code>row[0]</code> and <code>row[1]</code> - for example <code>mapper.set(row[0].toString + '-' + row[1], row);</code>. And, of course when you use <code>mapper.has( key )</code> and <code>mapper.get( key )</code>, you need to build the key in the same way, from the <code>arrayBig</code> data. The key is the "unique identifier" - whether that be the first field, the first two fields, or something different.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">andrewJames</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">18 Jul 2021 at 14:41</span></td>

     <p>Just in case. Another solution:</p>
     <p></p>
     <div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">
      <div class="snippet-code">
       <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var arrayBig    = [ [1,"A","B"], [2,"C","D"], [3,"E","F"], [4,"G","H"] ];
var arraySmall  = [ [1,"P","Q"], [3,"Y","Z"] ];

var obj = {}; // it will be { "1":[1,"P","Q"], "3": [3,"Y","Z"] }

arraySmall.forEach( x =&gt; obj[x[0]] = x );

arrayBig = arrayBig.map( x =&gt; obj[x[0]] || x );

console.log(arrayBig); // [[1,"P","Q"], [2,"C","D"], [3,"Y","Z"], [4,"G","H"]];</code></pre>
      </div>
     </div>
     <p></p>
     <p>It converts the small array into an object where first element of every row is a key and the row is its value. Then it loops through the big array and tries to get values of the object by keys (a first cell). If the key exists the row will replace, if key doesn't exist the for wont change.</p>
     <p>Sequence of the rows in the small array doesn't matter as well.</p>
     <p><strong>Updage</strong></p>
     <p>You can use an array instead of an object if you want:</p>
     <p></p>
     <div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">
      <div class="snippet-code">
       <pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var arrayBig = [ [1,"A","B"], [2,"C","D"], [3,"E","F"], [4,"G","H"] ];
var arraySmall  = [ [1,"P","Q"], [3,"Y","Z"] ];

var arr = [];

arraySmall.forEach( x =&gt; arr[x[0]-1] = x ); // [ [1,"P","Q"], [], [3,"Y","Z"], [] ];

arrayBig = arrayBig.map( (x,i) =&gt; arr[i] || x);

console.log(arrayBig);</code></pre>
      </div>
     </div>
     <p></p>
     <p>I think it will take more memory, but it works. But you need to be sure that first cells contain numbers only, since they're using as indexes of the array (indexes of array should be numbers, unlike keys that can be anything). And rows of first array should be sorted and has no skipped numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, etc). So, it's a more fragile solution. Just for educational purposes.</p>
