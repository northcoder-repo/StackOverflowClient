     <p>Well, both will clean. That means they'll remove the target folder. The real question is what's the difference between package and install?</p>
     <p><code>package</code> will compile your code and also package it. For example, if your pom says the project is a jar, it will create a jar for you when you package it and put it somewhere in the target directory (by default).</p>
     <p><code>install</code> will compile and package, but it will also put the package in your local repository. This will make it so other projects can refer to it and grab it from your local repository.</p>

     <p>What clean does (common in both the commands) - removes all files generated by the previous build</p>
     <hr>
     <p>Coming to the difference between the commands <strong>package</strong> and <strong>install</strong>, you first need to understand the <em><strong>lifecycle of a maven project</strong></em></p>
     <hr>
     <p>These are the default life cycle phases in maven</p>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>validate</strong> - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available</li>
      <li><strong>compile</strong> - compile the source code of the project</li>
      <li><strong>test</strong> - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed</li>
      <li><strong>package</strong> - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.</li>
      <li><strong>verify</strong> - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met</li>
      <li><strong>install</strong> - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally</li>
      <li><strong>deploy</strong> - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.</li>
     </ul>
     <hr>
     <p>How Maven works is, if you run a command for any of the lifecycle phases, it executes each default life cycle phase in order, before executing the command itself.</p>
     <p>order of execution</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>validate &gt;&gt; compile &gt;&gt; test (optional) &gt;&gt; package &gt;&gt; verify &gt;&gt; install &gt;&gt; deploy</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>So when you run the command <em><strong>mvn package</strong></em>, it runs the commands for all lifecycle phases till package</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>validate &gt;&gt; compile &gt;&gt; test (optional) &gt;&gt; package</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>And as for <em><strong>mvn install</strong></em>, it runs the commands for all lifecycle phases till install, which includes package as well</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>validate &gt;&gt; compile &gt;&gt; test (optional) &gt;&gt; package &gt;&gt; verify &gt;&gt; install</p>
     </blockquote>
     <hr>
     <p>So, effectively what it means is, <strong>install</strong> commands does everything that <strong>package</strong> command does and some more (install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally)</p>

     <p><code>package</code> will add packaged <code>jar</code> or <code>war</code> to your <code>target</code> folder, We can check it when, we empty the target folder (using <code>mvn clean</code>) and then run <code>mvn package</code>. <br><code>install</code> will do all the things that <code>package</code> does, additionally it will add packaged <code>jar</code> or <code>war</code> in local repository as well. We can confirm it by checking in your <code>.m2</code> folder.</p>

     <p>Package &amp; install are various phases in maven build lifecycle. package phase will execute all phases prior to that &amp; it will stop with packaging the project as a jar. Similarly install phase will execute all prior phases &amp; finally install the project locally for other dependent projects.</p>

     <p>mvn install command is mostly used when you wants to compile a project(library) which other projects in your repository are depending on.</p>
