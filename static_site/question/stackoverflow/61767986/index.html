   <div>
    <p>I've recently moved from 1.9 to 1.10 and the pagination behavior is changed for ajax request.</p>
    <p>In 1.9 I could not pass <code>iTotalDisplayRecords</code> or <code>iTotalRecords</code> and the pagination was still available as long as I was sending <code>sEcho</code> back.</p>
    <p>This seems to no longer work in 1.10 and as long as I don't send <code>recordsTotal</code> value, pagination remains disabled.</p>
    <p>I have some tables which contains 500k+ rows in db, counting them all to generate <code>recordsTotal</code> could be costly, especially if I need to do that on every page change.</p>
    <p>I could build a caching mechanism which is also not the perfect solution as the first time I would still need to count these rows against my db, which could take some time and create slower experience.</p>
    <p>Is there any other solution that I'm missing to keep the pagination available without counting all rows in db?</p>
    <p>Thank you.</p>

     <p>You can customize the pagination information message.</p>
     <p>Example:</p>
     <pre><code>$('#example').DataTable({
  "language": {
    "info": "Showing entries _START_ to _END_"
  }
});
</code></pre>
     <p>See <a href="https://datatables.net/reference/option/language" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for the related documentation.</p>
     <p>You may also need to adjust this part of the message:</p>
     <pre><code>"infoFiltered": "(filtered from _MAX_ total entries)"
</code></pre>
     <p>After doing this, you will no longer need to count total rows, because that info is never displayed.</p>

        <td><span>OK - understood. Assuming you have 500,000 database records, but you are only sending 100 records at a time to the client, what is the expected result for the page numbering (the section which shows "Previous 1 2 3 ... n Next"). What value of "n" should be displayed, to represent the maximum page number?</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">andrewJames</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">14 May 2020 at 12:11</span></td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td><span>Also, in case it helps - I tested a server-side DataTable with a <code>recordsTotal</code> value hard-coded to -1 (and then I hid the <code>"infoFiltered"</code> message). The pagination buttons are working OK (they are not deactivated). But you still have the issue of what you need the "max page number" to be. At some point I assume you will have to re-count the database records (perhaps in a separate process) to ensure a user can reach the correct "final page".</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">andrewJames</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">14 May 2020 at 12:25</span></td>

       <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td><span>I've also tested with -1 value but the First/Prev/Next/Last buttons were disabled, only the page numbers were enabled. The only way I've figured out to overcome this is to make a hack to return something like: <code>count(items) &gt; pageLength : count(items) * start + pageLength : count(items) * start</code> and hope for the best, but yeah, it's not exactly perfect... If there's no native resolve for this then I suppose I will need to create a caching mechanism to count total records and store the value.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">alechko</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">15 May 2020 at 14:46</span></td>
