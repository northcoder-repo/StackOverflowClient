    <p>I'm trying to undo all changes since my last commit. I tried <code>git reset --hard</code> and <code>git reset --hard HEAD</code> after viewing <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7999259/git-how-to-perform-the-tfs-equivalent-of-undo-pending-changes">this post</a>. I responds with head is now at 18c3773... but when I look at my local source all the files are still there. What am I missing?</p>

     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>This will unstage all files you might have staged with <code>git add</code>:</p>
       <pre><code>git reset
</code></pre></li>
      <li>
       <p>This will revert all local uncommitted changes (should be executed in repo root):</p>
       <pre><code>git checkout .
</code></pre>
       <p>You can also revert uncommitted changes only to particular file or directory:</p>
       <pre><code>git checkout [some_dir|file.txt]
</code></pre>
       <p>Yet another way to revert all uncommitted changes (longer to type, but works from any subdirectory):</p>
       <pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD
</code></pre></li>
      <li>
       <p>This will remove all local untracked files, so <em>only</em> git tracked files remain:</p>
       <pre><code>git clean -fdx
</code></pre>
       <blockquote>
        <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> <code>-x</code> will also remove all ignored files, including ones specified by <code>.gitignore</code>! You may want to use <code>-n</code> for preview of files to be deleted.</p>
       </blockquote></li>
     </ul>
     <hr>
     <p>To sum it up: executing commands below is basically equivalent to fresh <code>git clone</code> from original source (but it does not re-download anything, so is much faster):</p>
     <pre><code>git reset
git checkout .
git clean -fdx
</code></pre>
     <p>Typical usage for this would be in build scripts, when you must make sure that your tree is absolutely clean - does not have any modifications or locally created object files or build artefacts, and you want to make it work very fast and to not re-clone whole repository every single time.</p>

     <p>If you wish to "<strong>undo</strong>" all uncommitted changes simply run:</p>
     <pre><code>git stash
git stash drop
</code></pre>
     <p>If you have any untracked files (check by running <code>git status</code>), these may be removed by running:</p>
     <p><strong>Warning</strong>: This will remove all non-commited data, <strong>even what is in <code>.gitignore</code></strong></p>
     <pre><code>git clean -fdx
</code></pre>
     <p><code>git stash</code> creates a new stash which will become <strong>stash@{0}</strong>. If you wish to check first you can run <code>git stash list</code> to see a list of your stashes. It will look something like:</p>
     <pre><code>stash@{0}: WIP on rails-4: 66c8407 remove forem residuals
stash@{1}: WIP on master: 2b8f269 Map qualifications
stash@{2}: WIP on master: 27a7e54 Use non-dynamic finders
stash@{3}: WIP on blogit: c9bd270 some changes
</code></pre>
     <p>Each stash is named after the previous commit messsage.</p>

      <p>Adding this answer because the previous answers <strong>permanently delete</strong> your changes</p>

     <h1>The Safe way</h1>
     <p><code>git stash -u</code></p>
     <p>Explanation: Stash local changes <strong>including</strong> untracked changes (<code>-u</code> flag). The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.</p>
     <h2>Want to recover the changes later?</h2>
     <p><code>git stash pop</code></p>
     <p>Explanation: The command will reapply the changes to the top of the current working tree state.</p>
     <h2>Want to permanently remove the changes?</h2>
     <p><code>git stash drop</code></p>
     <p>Explanation: The command will permanently remove the stashed entry</p>

     <p>there is also <code>git stash</code> - which "stashes" your local changes and can be reapplied at a later time or dropped if is no longer required</p>

     <pre><code>git restore &lt;file&gt;

     <p>I'm using source tree.... You can do revert all uncommitted changes with 2 easy steps:</p>
     <p>1) just need to reset the workspace file status</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vbbIC.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vbbIC.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> 2) select all unstage files (command +a), right click and select remove</p>

     <p>There are three options in Git that help to undo your local changes.</p>
     <p>To view the changes that have been made in your working directory, you should run git status:</p>
     <pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git status
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>Undoing changes with git stash</strong><br>
       To discard all local changes, but also to save them for later use, you can run the git stash command:</p>
     <pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git stash
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>Undoing changes with git checkout</strong><br>
       To discard local changes to a file permanently, you can run:</p>
     <pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>Undoing changes with git reset</strong><br>
       To discard all local changes to all the files permanently, you can do:</p>
     <pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git reset --hard
</code></pre>

     <p>The following defines a reusable <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-alias" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Git command alias</a> to remove any local changes, which can then be used any time in the future to delete any uncommitted changes:</p>
     <pre class="lang-console prettyprint-override"><code>git config --global alias.remove-changes '!git stash push --include-untracked &amp;&amp; git stash drop'
</code></pre>
     <p>Using the alias is straightforward:</p>
     <pre class="lang-console prettyprint-override"><code>git remove-changes
</code></pre>
     <p>The alias pushes all changes to the stash (including uncommitted ones) using <code>git stash push --include-untracked</code>, then drops the newly created stash entry using <code>git stash drop</code>.</p>

     <p><code>git status</code> showed that I had some files that were changed, but I wanted to get rid of those and start a new branch. Until today, I had been using git reset approach, which I do like for jumping back to other specific commits.</p>

     <p>just type <code>ugit</code> and it provides to you a list of options that you can choose to undo that git command</p>
