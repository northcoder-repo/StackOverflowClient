    <p>What is the difference between a <code>DateTime</code> and a <code>DateTimeOffset</code> and when should one be used?</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Currently, we have a standard way of dealing with .NET <code>DateTime</code>s in a TimeZone-aware way: Whenever we produce a <code>DateTime</code> we do it in UTC (e.g. using <code>DateTime.UtcNow</code>), and whenever we display one, we convert back from UTC to the user's local time.</p>
    <p>That works fine, but I've been reading about <code>DateTimeOffset</code> and how it captures the local and UTC time in the object itself.</p>

     <p><code>DateTimeOffset</code> is a representation of <em>instantaneous time</em> (also known as <em>absolute time</em>). By that, I mean a moment in time that is universal for everyone (not accounting for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second" rel="noreferrer">leap seconds</a>, or the relativistic effects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation" rel="noreferrer">time dilation</a>). Another way to represent instantaneous time is with a <code>DateTime</code> where <code>.Kind</code> is <code>DateTimeKind.Utc</code>.</p>
     <p>This is distinct from <em>calendar time</em> (also known as <em>civil time</em>), which is a position on someone's calendar, and there are many different calendars all over the globe. We call these calendars <em>time zones</em>. Calendar time is represented by a <code>DateTime</code> where <code>.Kind</code> is <code>DateTimeKind.Unspecified</code>, or <code>DateTimeKind.Local</code>. And <code>.Local</code> is only meaningful in scenarios where you have an implied understanding of where the computer that is using the result is positioned. (For example, a user's workstation)</p>
     <p>So then, why <code>DateTimeOffset</code> instead of a UTC <code>DateTime</code>? <strong>It's all about perspective.</strong> Let's use an analogy - we'll pretend to be photographers.</p>
     <p>Imagine you are standing on a calendar timeline, pointing a camera at a person on the instantaneous timeline laid out in front of you. You line up your camera according to the rules of your timezone - which change periodically due to daylight saving time, or due to other changes to the legal definition of your time zone. (You don't have a steady hand, so your camera is shaky.)</p>
     <p>The person standing in the photo would see the angle at which your camera came from. If others were taking pictures, they could be from different angles. This is what the <code>Offset</code> part of the <code>DateTimeOffset</code> represents.</p>
     <p>So if you label your camera "Eastern Time", sometimes you are pointing from -5, and sometimes you are pointing from -4. There are cameras all over the world, all labeled different things, and all pointing at the same instantaneous timeline from different angles. Some of them are right next to (or on top of) each other, so just knowing the offset isn't enough to determine which timezone the time is related to.</p>
     <p>And what about UTC? Well, it's the one camera out there that is guaranteed to have a steady hand. It's on a tripod, firmly anchored into the ground. It's not going anywhere. We call its angle of perspective the zero offset.</p>
     <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QE5xq.png" alt="Instantaneous Time vs Calendar Time Visualization"></p>
     <p>So - what does this analogy tell us? It provides some intuitive guidelines-</p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>If you are representing time relative to some place in particular, represent it in calendar time with a <code>DateTime</code>. Just be sure you don't ever confuse one calendar with another. <code>Unspecified</code> should be your assumption. <code>Local</code> is only useful coming from <code>DateTime.Now</code>. For example, I might get <code>DateTime.Now</code> and save it in a database - but when I retrieve it, I have to assume that it is <code>Unspecified</code>. I can't rely that my local calendar is the same calendar that it was originally taken from.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>If you must always be certain of the moment, make sure you are representing instantaneous time. Use <code>DateTimeOffset</code> to enforce it, or use UTC <code>DateTime</code> by convention.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>If you need to track a moment of instantaneous time, but you want to also know "What time did the user think it was on their local calendar?" - then you <em>must</em> use a <code>DateTimeOffset</code>. This is very important for timekeeping systems, for example - both for technical and legal concerns.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>If you ever need to modify a previously recorded <code>DateTimeOffset</code> - you don't have enough information in the offset alone to ensure that the new offset is still relevant for the user. You must <em>also</em> store a timezone identifier (think - I need the name of that camera so I can take a new picture even if the position has changed).</p>
       <p>It should also be pointed out that <a href="http://nodatime.org" rel="noreferrer">Noda Time</a> has a representation called <code>ZonedDateTime</code> for this, while the .Net base class library does not have anything similar. You would need to store both a <code>DateTimeOffset</code> and a <code>TimeZoneInfo.Id</code> value.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Occasionally, you will want to represent a calendar time that is local to "whomever is looking at it". For example, when defining what <em>today</em> means. Today is always midnight to midnight, but these represent a near-infinite number of overlapping ranges on the instantaneous timeline. (In practice we have a finite number of timezones, but you can express offsets down to the tick) So in these situations, make sure you understand how to either limit the "who's asking?" question down to a single time zone, or deal with translating them back to instantaneous time as appropriate.</p></li>
     </ul>
     <p>Here are a few other little bits about <code>DateTimeOffset</code> that back up this analogy, and some tips for keeping it straight:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>If you compare two <code>DateTimeOffset</code> values, they are first normalized to zero offset before comparing. In other words, <code>2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</code> and <code>2012-01-01T02:00:00+02:00</code> refer to the same instantaneous moment, and are therefore equivalent.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>If you are doing any unit testing and need to be certain of the offset, test <em>both</em> the <code>DateTimeOffset</code> value, and the <code>.Offset</code> property separately.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>There is a one-way implicit conversion built in to the .Net framework that lets you pass a <code>DateTime</code> into any <code>DateTimeOffset</code> parameter or variable. When doing so, <strong>the <code>.Kind</code> matters</strong>. If you pass a UTC kind, it will carry in with a zero offset, but if you pass either <code>.Local</code> or <code>.Unspecified</code>, it will assume to be <strong>local</strong>. The framework is basically saying, "Well, you asked me to convert calendar time to instantaneous time, but I have no idea where this came from, so I'm just going to use the local calendar." This is a huge gotcha if you load up an unspecified <code>DateTime</code> on a computer with a different timezone. (IMHO - that should throw an exception - but it doesn't.)</p></li>
     </ul>
     <p><strong>Shameless Plug:</strong></p>
     <p>Many people have shared with me that they find this analogy extremely valuable, so I included it in my Pluralsight course, <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/date-time-fundamentals" rel="noreferrer">Date and Time Fundamentals</a>. You'll find a step-by-step walkthrough of the camera analogy in the second module, "Context Matters", in the clip titled "Calendar Time vs. Instantaneous Time".</p>

You can convert that to the user's time zone on display on the way out. Pass the UTC DateTime up to the controller or web form, and convert it to the users local time just before it leaves your web server. If you are rendering HTML, then you should decide right there how to format it for your users culture. If you are passing it as data (XML, JSON, etc) then you might want to pass as ISO8601 and format it later using MomentJS.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Matt Johnson-Pint</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">29 Mar 2013 at 14:03</span></td>

If we had stored <code>DateTimeOffset</code> originally, then none of that is required because we recorded <i>both</i> the local time, and the value necessary to convert to UTC, in one data value.

     <blockquote>
      <p>These uses for DateTimeOffset values are much more common than those for DateTime values. As a result, DateTimeOffset should be considered the default date and time type for application development.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p><sub>source: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/datetime/choosing-between-datetime" rel="noreferrer">"Choosing Between DateTime, DateTimeOffset, TimeSpan, and TimeZoneInfo"</a>, <em>MSDN</em></sub></p>
     <p>We use <code>DateTimeOffset</code> for nearly everything as our application deals with particular points in time (e.g. when a record was created/updated). As a side note, we use <code>DATETIMEOFFSET</code> in SQL Server 2008 as well.</p>
     <p>I see <code>DateTime</code> as being useful when you want to deal with dates only, times only, or deal with either in a generic sense. For example, if you have an alarm that you want to go off every day at 7 am, you could store that in a <code>DateTime</code> utilizing a <code>DateTimeKind</code> of <code>Unspecified</code> because you want it to go off at 7am regardless of DST. But if you want to represent the history of alarm occurrences, you would use <code>DateTimeOffset</code>.</p>
     <p>Use caution when using a mix of <code>DateTimeOffset</code> and <code>DateTime</code> especially when assigning and comparing between the types. Also, only compare <code>DateTime</code> instances that are the same <code>DateTimeKind</code> because <code>DateTime</code> ignores timezone offset when comparing.</p>

     <p>DateTime is capable of storing only two distinct times, the local time and UTC. The <em>Kind</em> property indicates which.</p>
     <p>DateTimeOffset expands on this by being able to store local times from anywhere in the world. It also stores the <em>offset</em> between that local time and UTC. Note how DateTime cannot do this unless you'd add an extra member to your class to store that UTC offset. Or only ever work with UTC. Which in itself is a fine idea btw.</p>

     <p>The most important distinction is that DateTime does not store time zone information, while DateTimeOffset does.</p>
     <p>Although DateTime distinguishes between UTC and Local, there is absolutely no explicit time zone offset associated with it. If you do any kind of serialization or conversion, the server's time zone is going to be used. Even if you manually create a local time by adding minutes to offset a UTC time, you can still get bit in the serialization step, because (due to lack of any explicit offset in DateTime) it will use the server's time zone offset.</p>
     <p>For example, if you serialize a DateTime value with Kind=Local using Json.Net and an ISO date format, you'll get a string like <code>2015-08-05T07:00:00-04</code>. Notice that last part (-04) had nothing to do with your DateTime or any offset you used to calculate it... it's just purely the server's time zone offset.</p>
     <p>Meanwhile, DateTimeOffset explicitly includes the offset. It may not include the name of the time zone, but at least it includes the offset, and if you serialize it, you're going to get the explicitly included offset in your value instead of whatever the server's local time happens to be.</p>

     <p>There's a few places where <code>DateTimeOffset</code> makes sense. One is when you're dealing with recurring events and daylight savings time. Let's say I want to set an alarm to go off at 9am every day. If I use the "store as UTC, display as local time" rule, then the alarm will be going off at a <em>different</em> time when daylight savings time is in effect.</p>
     <p>There are probably others, but the above example is actually one that I've run into in the past (this was before the addition of <code>DateTimeOffset</code> to the BCL - my solution at the time was to explicitly store the time in the local timezone, and save the timezone information along side it: basically what <code>DateTimeOffset</code> does internally).</p>

     <p>A major difference is that <code>DateTimeOffset</code> can be used in conjunction with <code>TimeZoneInfo</code> to convert to local times in timezones other than the current one.</p>
     <p>This is useful on a server application (e.g. ASP.NET) that is accessed by users in different timezones.</p>

     <p>I say go ahead and use DateTimeOffset and TimeZoneInfo because of all the benefits, just beware when creating entities which will or may be serialized to or from XML (all business objects then).</p>
