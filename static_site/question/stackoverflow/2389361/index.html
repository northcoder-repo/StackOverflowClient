    <p>I accidentally ran <code>git merge some_other_branch</code> on my local master branch. I haven't pushed the changes to origin master. How do I undo the merge?</p>
    <hr>
    <p>After merging, <code>git status</code> says:</p>
    <pre><code># On branch master
# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 5 commits.
</code></pre>
    <p>How do I undo all these commits?</p>

     <p>With <code>git reflog</code> check which commit is one prior the merge (<code>git reflog</code> will be a better option than <code>git log</code>). Then you can reset it using:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard commit_sha
</code></pre>
     <p>There's also another way:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~1
</code></pre>
     <p>It will get you back 1 commit.</p>
     <p><strong>Be aware that any modified and uncommitted/unstashed files will be reset to their unmodified state</strong>. To keep them either stash changes away or see <code>--merge</code> option below.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>As @Velmont suggested below in his answer, in this direct case using:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD
</code></pre>
     <p>might yield better results, as it should preserve your changes. <code>ORIG_HEAD</code> will point to a commit directly before merge has occurred, so you don't have to hunt for it yourself.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>A further tip is to use the <code>--merge</code> switch instead of <code>--hard</code> since it doesn't reset files unnecessarily:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --merge ORIG_HEAD
</code></pre>
     <blockquote>
      <p>--merge</p>
      <p>Resets the index and updates the files in the working tree that are different between &lt;commit&gt; and HEAD, but keeps those which are different between the index and working tree (i.e. which have changes which have not been added).</p>

If you remove this one merge commit, then all of the older commits that came in from the merge will disappear, too. To be safe, though, after a reset git will tell you where the new head is: "HEAD is now at 88a04de &lt;commit message&gt;". I always look at that to make sure that I ended up where I expected to be.

     <p>It is strange that the simplest command was missing. Most answers work, but undoing the merge you just did, <strong>this is the easy and safe way</strong>:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --merge ORIG_HEAD
</code></pre>
     <p>The ref <code>ORIG_HEAD</code> will point to the original commit from before the merge.</p>
     <p>(The <code>--merge</code> option has nothing to do with the merge. It's just like <code>git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD</code>, but safer since it doesn't touch uncommitted changes.)</p>

     <p>With newer Git versions, if you have not committed the merge yet <em>and you have a merge conflict</em>, you can simply do:</p>
     <pre><code>git merge --abort

     <p>From <code>man git merge</code>:</p>

      <p>[This] can only be run after the merge has resulted in conflicts. <code>git merge --abort</code> will abort the merge process and try to reconstruct the pre-merge state.</p>

     <p>You should reset to the previous commit. This should work:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD^
</code></pre>
     <p>Or even <code>HEAD^^</code> to revert that revert commit. You can always give a full SHA reference if you're not sure how many steps back you should take.</p>
     <p>In case when you have problems and your master branch didn't have any local changes, you can reset to <code>origin/master</code>.</p>

     <p>Lately, I've been using <code>git reflog</code> to help with this. This mostly only works if the merge JUST happened, and it was on your machine.</p>
     <p><code>git reflog</code> might return something like:</p>
     <pre><code>fbb0c0f HEAD@{0}: commit (merge): Merge branch 'master' into my-branch
43b6032 HEAD@{1}: checkout: moving from master to my-branch
e3753a7 HEAD@{2}: rebase finished: returning to refs/heads/master
e3753a7 HEAD@{3}: pull --rebase: checkout e3753a71d92b032034dcb299d2df2edc09b5830e
b41ea52 HEAD@{4}: reset: moving to HEAD^
8400a0f HEAD@{5}: rebase: aborting
</code></pre>
     <p>The first line indicates that a merge occurred. The 2nd line is the time before my merge. I simply <code>git reset --hard 43b6032</code> to force this branch to track from before the merge, and carry-on.</p>

     <p>With modern Git, you can:</p>
     <pre><code>git merge --abort
</code></pre>
     <p>Older syntax:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --merge
</code></pre>
     <p>Old-school:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard
</code></pre>
     <p>But actually, it is worth noticing that <code>git merge --abort</code> is only equivalent to <code>git reset --merge</code> given that <code>MERGE_HEAD</code> is present. This can be read in the Git help for merge command.</p>
     <pre><code>git merge --abort is equivalent to git reset --merge when MERGE_HEAD is present.
</code></pre>
     <p>After a failed merge, when there is no <code>MERGE_HEAD</code>, the failed merge can be undone with <code>git reset --merge</code>, but not necessarily with <code>git merge --abort</code>, <strong>so they are not only old and new syntax for the same thing</strong>.</p>
     <p>Personally I find <code>git reset --merge</code> much more powerful and useful in everyday work, so that's the one I always use.</p>

     <p>Okay, the answers other people here gave me were close, but it didn't work. Here's what I did.</p>
     <p>Doing this...</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD^
git status
</code></pre>
     <p>...gave me the following status.</p>
     <pre><code># On branch master
# Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
# and have 3 and 3 different commit(s) each, respectively.
</code></pre>
     <p>I then had to type in the same <code>git reset</code> command several more times. Each time I did that, the message changed by one as you can see below.</p>
     <pre><code>&gt; git reset --hard HEAD^
HEAD is now at [...truncated...]
&gt; git status
# On branch master
# Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
# and have 3 and 3 different commit(s) each, respectively.
&gt; git reset --hard HEAD^
HEAD is now at [...truncated...]
&gt; git status
# On branch master
# Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
# and have 2 and 3 different commit(s) each, respectively.
&gt; git reset --hard HEAD^
HEAD is now at [...truncated...]
&gt; git status
# On branch master
# Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
# and have 1 and 3 different commit(s) each, respectively.
&gt; git reset --hard HEAD^
HEAD is now at [...truncated...]
&gt; git status
# On branch master
# Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 3 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
</code></pre>
     <p>At this point, I saw the status message changed, so I tried doing a <code>git pull</code>, and that seemed to work:</p>
     <pre><code>&gt; git pull
Updating 2df6af4..12bbd2f
Fast forward
 app/views/truncated |    9 ++++++---

 app/views/truncated |    2 +-
 3 files changed, 20 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)
&gt; git status
# On branch master
</code></pre>
     <p>So long story short, my commands came down to this:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD^
git reset --hard HEAD^
git reset --hard HEAD^
git reset --hard HEAD^
git pull
</code></pre>

     <p><strong>You have to change your HEAD, Not yours of course but git HEAD....</strong></p>
     <p>So before answering let's add some background, explaining what is this <code>HEAD</code>.</p>
     <h1><strong><em><code>First of all what is HEAD?</code></em></strong></h1>
     <p><code>HEAD</code> is simply a reference to the current commit (latest) on the current branch.<br>
       There can only be a single <code>HEAD</code> at any given time. (excluding <code>git worktree</code>)</p>
     <p>The content of <code>HEAD</code> is stored inside <code>.git/HEAD</code> and it contains the 40 bytes SHA-1 of the current commit.</p>
     <hr>
     <h1><strong><em><code>detached HEAD</code></em></strong></h1>
     <p>If you are not on the latest commit - meaning that <code>HEAD</code> is pointing to a prior commit in history its called <strong><em><code>detached HEAD</code></em></strong>.</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OlavO.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/2389361/OlavO.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
     <p>On the command line, it will look like this- SHA-1 instead of the branch name since the <code>HEAD</code> is not pointing to the tip of the current branch</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qplvo.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/2389361/qplvo.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

git checkout -b &lt;new branch&gt; &lt;commit_id&gt;
git checkout HEAD~X // x is the number of commits t go back
</code></pre>
     <p>This will checkout new branch pointing to the desired commit.<br>
       This command will checkout to a given commit.<br>
       At this point, you can create a branch and start to work from this point on.</p>
     <pre><code># Checkout a given commit. 
# Doing so will result in a `detached HEAD` which mean that the `HEAD`
# is not pointing to the latest so you will need to checkout branch
# in order to be able to update the code.

# create a new branch forked to the given commit

     <p>It can be done multiple ways.</p>
     <p><strong>1) Abort Merge</strong></p>
     <p>If you are in-between a bad merge (mistakenly done with wrong branch), and wanted to avoid the merge to go back to the branch latest as below:</p>
     <pre><code>git merge --abort
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>2) Reset HEAD to remote branch</strong></p>
     <p>If you are working from remote develop branch, you can reset HEAD to the last commit on remote branch as below:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard origin/develop
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>3) Delete current branch, and checkout again from the remote repository</strong></p>
     <p>Considering, you are working on develop branch in local repo, that syncs with remote/develop branch, you can do as below:</p>
     <pre><code>git checkout master 
##to delete one branch, you need to be on another branch, otherwise you will fall with the branch :) 

git branch -D develop
git checkout -b develop origin/develop
</code></pre>

     <p>Got to this question also looking to revert to match origin (ie, NO commits ahead of origin). Researching further, found there's a <code>reset</code> command for exactly that:</p>
     <p><code>git reset --hard @{u}</code></p>
     <p>Note: <code>@{u}</code> is shorthand for <code>origin/master</code>. (And, of course, you need that remote repository for this to work.)</p>

     <p>You can use only two commands to revert a merge or restart by a specific commit:</p>
     <ol>
      <li><code>git reset --hard commitHash</code> (you should use the commit that you want to restart, eg. 44a587491e32eafa1638aca7738)</li>
      <li><code>git push origin HEAD --force</code> (Sending the new local master branch to origin/master)</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Good luck and go ahead!</p>

     <p>The simplest answer is the one given by odinho - Velmont</p>
     <p>First do <code>git reset --merge ORIG_HEAD</code></p>
     <p>For those looking to reset after changes are pushed, do this (Because this is the first post seen for any git reset merge questions)</p>
     <p><code>git push origin HEAD --force</code></p>
     <p>This will reset in a way that you won't get the merged changes back again after pull.</p>

     <p>Just for an extra option to look at, I've been mostly following the branching model described here: <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" rel="noreferrer">http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/</a> and as such have been merging with <code>--no-ff</code> (no fast forward) usually.</p>
     <p>I just read this page as I'd accidentally merged a testing branch instead of my release branch with master for deploying (website, master is what is live). The testing branch has two other branches merged to it and totals about six commits.</p>
     <p>So to revert the whole commit I just needed one <code>git reset --hard HEAD^</code> and it reverted the whole merge. Since the merges weren't fast forwarded the merge was a block and one step back is "branch not merged".</p>

     <p>If your merge and the corresponding commits were not pushed yet, you can always switch to another branch, delete the original one and re-create it.</p>
     <p>For example, I accidentally merged a develop branch into master and wanted to undo that. Using the following steps:</p>
     <pre><code>git checkout develop
git branch -D master
git branch -t master origin/master
</code></pre>
     <p>Voila! Master is at the same stage as origin, and your mis-merged state is erased.</p>

     <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Create a new branch from where everything was good.</p>
     <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Reverting a merge is hard. There are too many solutions, depending on many factors such as whether you've committed or pushed your merge or if there were new commits since your merge. Also you still need to have a relatively deep understanding of git to adapt these solutions to your case. If you blindly follow some instructions, you can end up with an "empty merge" where nothing will be merged, and further merge attempts will make Git tell you "Already up to date".</p>
     <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
     <p>Let's say you want to merge <code>dev</code> into <code>feature-1</code>.</p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>Find the revision that you want to receive the merge:</p>
       <pre><code>git log --oneline feature-1
a1b2c3d4 Merge branch 'dev' into 'feature-1' &lt;-- the merge you want to undo
e5f6g7h8 Fix NPE in the Zero Point Module &lt;-- the one before the merge, you probably want this one
</code></pre></li>
      <li>
       <p>Check it out (go back in time):</p>
       <pre><code>git checkout e5f6g7h8
</code></pre></li>
      <li>
       <p>Create a new branch from there and check it out:</p>
       <pre><code>git checkout -b feature-1
</code></pre></li>
     </ol>
     <p>Now you can restart your merge:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>Merge: <code>git merge dev</code></p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Fix your merge conflicts.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Commit: <code>git commit</code></p></li>
      <li>
       <p>When you're satisfied with the results, delete the old branch: <code>git branch --delete feature-1</code></p></li>
     </ol>

     <p>If you want a command-line solution, I suggest to just go with MBO's answer.</p>
     <p>If you're a newbie, you might like the graphical approach:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Kick off <code>gitk</code> (from the command line, or right click in file browser if you have that)</li>
      <li>You can easily spot the merge commit there - the first node from the top with two parents</li>
      <li>Follow the link to the first/left parent (the one on your current branch before the merge, usually red for me)</li>
      <li>On the selected commit, right-click "Reset branch to here", pick the hard reset there</li>

     <p>I think you can do <code>git rebase -i [hash] [branch_name]</code> where <code>[hash]</code> is the identifying hash for however far back you want to rewind plus one (or however many commits back you want to go) and then delete the lines for the commits in the editor that you don't want any more. Save the file. Exit. Pray. And it should be rewound. You might have to do a <code>git reset --hard</code>, but it should be good at this point. You can also use this to pull specific commits out of a stack, if you don't want to keep them in your history, but that can leave your repository in a state that you probably don't want.</p>

     <p>The simplest of the simplest chance, much simpler than anything said here:</p>
     <p>Remove your local branch (local, not remote) and pull it again. This way you'll undo the changes on your master branch and anyone will be affected by the change you don't want to push. Start it over.</p>

     <p>If you notice that you need to revert immediately after the merge and you haven't done anything else after the merge attempt, you can just issue this command: <code>git reset --hard HEAD@{1}</code>.</p>
     <p>Essentially, your merge <code>sha</code> will be pointing to <code>HEAD@{0}</code> if nothing else was committed after the merge and so <code>HEAD@{1}</code> will be the previous point before the merge.</p>

     <p>In this case, you will want to reset your branch with <code>git reset --hard &lt;branch_name&gt;</code>. If you want to save your changes before reseting them be sure to create a new branch and <code>git checkout &lt;branch_name&gt;</code>.</p>
     <p>You can reset the state to a specific commit with <code>git reset --hard &lt;commit_id&gt;</code> as well.</p>
     <p>If the changes have been pushed you can use <code>git revert &lt;branch_name&gt;</code> instead. Be sure to check out how to use <a href="https://kolosek.com/git-reset-revert-and-checkout/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">git revert and git checkout</a> in other scenarios as well.</p>

     <p>You can use the git-reset command.</p>
