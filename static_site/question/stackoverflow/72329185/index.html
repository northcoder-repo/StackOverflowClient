    </div>
   </div>
   <div>
    <p>I am running a Java web application from NetBeans using Tomcat as the Servlet container.</p>
    <p>I previously had a <code>Context</code> element in the <code>META-INF</code> folder (<code>META-INF/context.xml</code>) which defined the path attribute as empty:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;Context path=""&gt;
...
&lt;/Context&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>(This is my context for in-place deployment from C:[projectname]\build\web when running on my local machine from NetBeans).</p>
    <p>The app is run on my local machine by right-clicking on the project and slecting "run". From inspecting the files, I think that NetBeans is creating a build folder and placing all compiled files in it and this is where my project is run from (as opposed to when I deploy on my production environment and simply drop a war file in the <code>webapps</code> folder). (this is what I think is happening - not sure).</p>
    <p>After upgrading Tomcat (from <code>8.0.43</code> to <code>10.0.21</code>), a warning started showing up:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>The path attribute with value [] in deployment descriptor [...] has been ignored</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So I removed the path attribute from the <code>Context</code> element.</p>
    <p>However, this caused my build to fail:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Cannot deploy the module. The context.xml file seems to be broken. Check whether it is well-formed and valid.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>How can I fix this? What am I not understanding?</p>

Specifically: (a) upgraded from 8.0.43 to 10.0.21, (b) <code>context.xml</code> is the name of the file containing my <code>context</code> element, (c) I'm not sure, I tried to figure out exactly what's going on. It's the default action netbeans takes when you right-click the project and click "run". It compiles my files and places them in a <code>build</code> directory and runs the webapp from there I think (unlike on production where I build a <code>war</code> and drop it into the <code>webapps</code> folder).</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">theyuv</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">22 May 2022 at 15:12</span></td>

     <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
     <p>I am able to recreate your "failed deployment" problem. It is specifically related to how NetBeans integrates with Tomcat, when managing Tomcat projects directly from within NetBeans.</p>
     <p>Although the warning you mentioned can be ignored (when the deployment succeeds), it's worth taking a closer look at how NetBeans manages Tomcat deployments. Also I think the error message is a bit misleading. In your case, it is not due to a broken/invalid XML file, but rather to a missing XML file.</p>
     <p>As you note in the question:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>NetBeans is creating a build folder and placing all compiled files in it and this is where my project is run from</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>And yes this is different from when you drop a WAR into the <code>webapps</code> folder, when you run your application outside of NetBeans (e.g. in Production).</p>
     <hr>
     <p><strong>Details</strong></p>
     <p>Let's first assume your application is called "TomcatBasicDemo" and this is the name you want to use for your application's root context - for example:</p>
     <pre><code>http://localhost:8080/TomcatBasicDemo/
</code></pre>
     <p>(We will look at the <code>path=""</code> example later).</p>
     <p>NetBeans finds your app's context name in the <code>context.xml</code> file in your application's <code>META-INF</code> directory - for example:</p>
     <pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;Context path="/TomcatBasicDemo"/&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>NetBeans uses this path value (<code>TomcatBasicDemo</code>) to create a file in the Tomcat server you are using for your web project - for example:</p>
     <pre><code>C:\tomcat\apache-tomcat-10.0.21\conf\Catalina\localhost\TomcatBasicDemo.xml
</code></pre>
     <p>As you can see, the name of the file is based on the path from your <code>context.xml</code> file.</p>
     <p>Inside this new <code>TomcatBasicDemo.xml</code> file you will see something like the following:</p>
     <pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;Context docBase="C:\NetBeansProjects\TomcatBasicDemo\target\TomcatBasicDemo" path="/TomcatBasicDemo"/&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>That <code>docBase</code> path is the directory you mention in your question - the "build" directory created by NetBeans.</p>
     <p>This is the mechanism which NetBeans uses to "deploy to Tomcat" instead of dropping a WAR file into the <code>webapps</code> directory. It allows NetBeans to keep its code in its own project structure, separate &amp; externalfrom Tomcat.</p>
     <p>(I assume this also probably simplifies code debugging from within NetBeans.)</p>
     <hr>
     <p><strong>What About the Build Failure?</strong></p>
     <p>Now you get that warning:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>The path attribute with value [] in deployment descriptor [...] has been ignored</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>If you try to handle that warning by editing your application's <code>META-INF/context.xml</code> file and removing the <code>path="/TomcatBasicDemo"</code> attribute, then NetBeans will no longer be able to create the XML file in Tomcat's <code>conf\Catalina\localhost</code> directory because it will not know what the file needs to be called.</p>
     <p>This is why Tomcat "<em>Cannot deploy the module.</em>". The XML file it needs is missing.</p>
     <hr>
     <p><strong>What about <code>path=""</code>?</strong></p>
     <p>Coming to the specific example in your question, if your application's <code>META-INF/context.xml</code> file contains the following:</p>
     <pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;Context path=""/&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>...then that is valid - since the empty string defaults to a file called <code>ROOT.xml</code> in Tomcat's <code>conf/Catalina/localhost</code> directory.</p>
     <hr>
     <p><strong>What about the Warning?</strong></p>
     <p>You can safely ignore it. It is purely for informational purposes.</p>
     <p>I don't know of any way to prevent NetBeans from including that <code>path</code> parameter when it creates the <code>TomcatBasicDemo.xml</code> file - or the <code>ROOT.xml</code> file (in your case, for <code>path=""</code>).</p>
     <p>There are more details provided in the Tomcat configuration documentation for the context container - including a table showing examples of how these XML file names are derived: <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-10.0-doc/config/context.html#Naming" rel="nofollow noreferrer">contexts and naming guidelines</a>.</p>
     <p>I was not able to find an obvious changelog entry for when this warning was introduced.</p>

     <blockquote>
      <p>This attribute must only be used when statically defining a Context in server.xml. In all other circumstances, the path will be inferred from the filenames used for either the .xml context file or the docBase.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>If context file is named <code>myapp.xml</code> then the app will appear under <code>/myapp</code> and the warning can be safely ignored.</p>
     <p>As the error posted by the OP, the xml file must be invalid itself regardless of tomcat.</p>
     <p>As a test on tomcat 9, create a context file as below under <code>/usr/share/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/myapp.xml</code> and start tomcat</p>
     <pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;Context /&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>The log shows an error because <code>/srv/tomcat/webapps/myapp</code> does not exist but other apps are started anyway and there's no error about malformed XML files</p>
