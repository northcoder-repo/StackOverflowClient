   <div>
    <p>I just started writing java and today I read some code like this:</p>
    <pre><code>public interface A extends B&lt;A&gt;{
    ...
}

public interface B&lt;E extends B&lt;E&gt;&gt;{
    ...
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Of course I can understand the code, but it makes me really confused. It looks like ... I used myself to create myself? How the compiler deal with it?</p>

     <p>To answer your explicit question, the compiler validates generics by checking constraints against each other, validating that the specific types in question are legal/matching the generic references. After that (for the output code) generic types are erased. This is called 'type erasure'. The explicit steps are explained here: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/erasure.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/erasure.html</a></p>
     <p><em>But more interesting are the semantics of what you apparently encountered.</em></p>
     <p>Generic types don't mean 'use to create' but rather 'regarding' (in whatever way). Take <code>List</code> for instance. <code>List&lt;A&gt;</code> means 'List containing instances of class A'. For the code calling an instance of that, it means that all methods referencing the generic type will directly or indirectly regard object(s) of type A.</p>
     <p>Any class implementing <code>public interface B&lt;E extends B&lt;E&gt;&gt;</code> will be required to regard themselves in that respect. The point of this might be that at a later point methods or attributes that refer to <code>E</code> will then yield the type implementing them. An example could be:</p>
     <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public interface Chainable&lt;E extends Chainable&lt;E&gt;&gt; {
  public void append(E followup);

  public E getNext();
}

...

public class MyLink implements Chainable&lt;MyLink&gt; {
  public void append(MyLink l) {
    ...
  }

  public MyLink getNext() {
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
     <p>This way, it is ensured, that any class implementing Chainable will have a method taking, and one returning an object of that class, rather than just any object.</p>
     <p>While the above alone is useful in terms of constraints I cannot see the better use of your example's <code>public interface A extends B&lt;A&gt;</code>. The reason for this is, that any class now implementing <code>A</code> is just guaranteed to regard <code>A</code> but not the implementing class itself (which would be much more useful). Example:</p>
     <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public class C implements A {
  public A methodDeclaredInB(A someParam) {
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
     <p>The method above only knows <code>A</code> at compile time, but not <code>C</code>. If instead someone wrote:</p>
     <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public class C implements B&lt;C&gt; {
  public C methodDeclaredInB(C someParam) {
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
     <p>then class <code>C</code> could be used instead of 'only' <code>A</code>.</p>
     <p>There may be cases where it is sufficient to know type <code>A</code>, but usually you want type <code>C</code>, so making a (itself non-generic) interface <code>A</code> that extends <code>B</code> in such a way seems a fragile shortcut to the more verbose but more useful example above.</p>

A class implementing <code>Chainable&lt;E&gt;</code> will only be guaranteed to have one method taking, and one method returning, <code>E</code>, not necessarily the type of the implementing class.

And as for the earlier comment: <code>public interface Chainable&lt;E extends Chainable&lt;E&gt;&gt;</code> binds <code>E</code> to <code>Chainable&lt;E&gt;</code>. This is important and makes a difference. You can easiely verify that in an IDE: A type <i>not</i> <code>Chainable&lt;E&gt;</code> cannot be the generic type <code>E</code>, which is the purpose.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">TreffnonX</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">30 Sep 2020 at 05:33</span></td>

     <p>Yes it is astonishing what the compiler is capable of. As said by the other answer(s), generic parameters are used by reference. But there are compilations (.class) and their dependent relations. Notice: some runtime errors are caused by unsynchronized compilation, and you can store a .java file in a jar - I believe).</p>
     <p>That juggling with self-references is often used to pass the class of a child class to a super class for restricting things (methods) to the child class.</p>
     <p>But the same trick of cyclic behavior can be done as pure classes:</p>
     <pre><code>public interface Foo {
    Foo ZERO = new Bar();
}

public class Bar implements Foo {
    ... ZERO ...
}
</code></pre>
     <p>So the java compiler solves this chicken/egg problem.</p>
