    <p>Im guessing it's there for a reason, but I can't seem to find any answer to this question.</p>
    <p>In short I have a django app where users get set badges that months or even years down the line need to be auto removed for which I use celery.</p>
    <p>My question is will setting consumer_timeout to large values pose a risk for those actions to not be performed or performed early/late (mind you a delay of even a few hours shouldn't be a big deal for long duration tasks)</p>

       <td><span>Hello thanks for the replies, so It seems I have misunderstood what consumer_timeout is, I thought it was the duration of which tasks are kept before they are thrown out, so my bad for the stupid question. I will turn consumer_timeout as it does not seem necessary for my needs (since if a task gets run then there is no way of it failing and that there would be no way of me akg my tasks outside of the tasks). Thank you a lot for the answers ^^.

     <p>The <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/consumers.html#acknowledgement-timeout" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>consumer_timeout</code></a> setting does not appear to be relevant to your long-term Celery tasks.</p>
     <p>The setting serves an unrelated purpose. It is:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>"a protection mechanism that helps detect buggy (stuck) consumers that never acknowledge deliveries. Such consumers can affect node's on disk data compaction and potentially drive nodes out of disk space."</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>A "high value" is considered to be "a few hours". Setting it to 10 years is effectively no different from not having any setting at all.</p>
