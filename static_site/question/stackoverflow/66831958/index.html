The function <code>fire</code> does not appear to be needed. Just use <code>swal(...)</code>. Where is your HTML element with <code>id="del"</code>? You are targeting what appears to be a non-existent element: $('#del'). After that, you would probably need to handle the link event, to allow your pop-up event to fire.

     <p>I am not sure where you are getting stuck.</p>
     <p>Here is my version:</p>
     <p>I am using SweetAlert 2:</p>
     <pre><code>&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sweetalert2@10.15.7/dist/sweetalert2.all.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>I have the following render function in my DataTable:</p>
     <pre><code>{
  render: function (data) {
    return '&lt;a id="del" href="/your/example/here/' + data + '"&gt;Remove&lt;/a&gt;';
  }
}
</code></pre>
     <p>This is a simplified version of your code, just as a demonstration.</p>
     <p>I have the following click handler:</p>
     <pre><code>$('#del').on('click', function( event ) {
  event.preventDefault(); // don't forget to prevent the default event
  Swal.fire({
    title: 'Are you sure?',
    text: "You won't be able to revert this!",
    icon: 'warning',
    showCancelButton: true,
    confirmButtonColor: '#3085d6',
    cancelButtonColor: '#d33',
    confirmButtonText: 'Yes, delete it!'
  }).then((result) =&gt; {
    if (result.isConfirmed) {
      Swal.fire(
        'Deleted!',
        'Your file has been deleted.',
        'success'
      )
    }
  });
});
</code></pre>
     <p>This generates a table with links.</p>
     <p>When I click on any link, I get the following pop-up alert:</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/moHmC.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/66831958/moHmC.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
     <p>I have not handled anything relating to actually using the link to delete a resource. I leave that up to you, as a follow-on task, after you get the alert working.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>You did not really explain what the <em>specific</em> problem is that you are facing, except to say "it's not working".</p>
     <p>If you have new, additional, problems after this then you can open a new question - but please try to provide sufficient details, including error messages from your browser's console and an easy-to-recreate problem description with related code.</p>

        <td><span>A warning? Or an error? Either way, that suggests you have simply not included the SweetAlert library correctly in your web page. Here is my MRE showing my code working: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/ukdbxmpw/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jsfiddle.net/ukdbxmpw</a> . Apart from that, maybe you should go back to the Swal tutorials and build the simplest alert you can possibly build, in a basic web page. That way you will know if you have imported the library correctly, or not. I think there is nothing more I can do to help you, given the information you have provided. I hope you are able to work it out. I wish you good luck.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">andrewJames</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">27 Mar 2021 at 22:32</span></td>
