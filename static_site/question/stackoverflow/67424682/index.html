    <p>I am creating an attendance tracker with the jQuery DataTables plugin! I have gotten really far with the functionality/capability and have just been stuck for weeks trying to figure out how to do this last portion of what I want it to do.</p>
    <p>I will have a static/workable test case attached below. So the issue that I cannot figure out is how to style the parent rows based off of the child row cell values. The columns Sunday-Friday are colored based off of a hidden value called SundayStatus, MondayStatus, TuesdayStatus, and so on. There are two values that could cause it to turn green (TW &amp; P), two values that could cause it to turn yellow (NR &amp; O), and two values to cause it to turn red (PTO &amp; H). In my <code>rows.every(function ( rowIdx, tableLoop, rowLoop ) {</code> function I need to find a way to manipulate the data and add classes to the parent rows based off the attendance values from each individual day.</p>
    <p>P.S.(I created my own plugin <code>$.fn.dataTable.ext.search.push(function</code> to search through all of the data in the table and only show items where the dates Sunday-Friday are dates that are in the current week.</p>
    <p><em><strong>UPDATE 5/10</strong></em> Andrew was on the right track with the update to his answer, I made one small change to today format, and changed <code>var result = Object.keys(data).find(key =&gt; data[key].substring(0,10) === today);</code> to <code>var result = Object.keys(data).find(key =&gt; typeof data[key] === 'string' &amp;&amp; data[key].startsWith(today));</code>. I then created a conditional in my dynamic code, to read through the result from the reverse-lookup and depending on what the result is, to color the row a certain color.</p>
    <p>Here is my JSFiddle of the Static Example that was previously in a snippet within the post: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/BeerusDev/y8t0xoze/19/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://jsfiddle.net/BeerusDev/y8t0xoze/19/</a></p>
    <p>In this update, my last and final issue that I am dealing with that I did not foresee, is that everything seems to be working fine, but it appends the status class from the first item that is posted to the DataTable and doesn't take into account for the other items. I have hit a mental block trying to figure out a way around this issue, but here is my rows.every function from my dynamic application which is inside of my startRender function</p>
    <pre><code>var statusClass = '';
                    rows.every(function ( rowIdx, tableLoop, rowLoop ) {
                    var data = this.data();

                    var node = this.node();

                    var today = moment().format("YYYY-MM-DD"); // "05/10/2021"
                    console.log(today);
                    
                    //console.log(JSON.stringify(data));

                    var result = Object.keys(data).find(key =&gt; typeof data[key] === 'string' &amp;&amp; data[key].startsWith(today)); // "Monday"
                    console.log(result);

                    var todayStatus = result ? data[result + 'Status'] : 'n/a'; 
                    console.log(todayStatus);
                    
                        if(todayStatus === "P" || todayStatus === "TW") {
                            statusClass = 'green';
                        }
                        if(todayStatus === "NR" || todayStatus === "O") {
                            statusClass = 'yellow';
                        }
                        if (todayStatus === "PTO" || todayStatus === "H") {
                            statusClass = 'red';
                        }
                    });
                    //Add category name to the &lt;tr&gt;.   
                        return $('&lt;tr/&gt;').addClass(statusClass)
                        .append('&lt;td colspan="8"&gt;' + group + ' (' + rows.count() + ')&lt;/td&gt;')
                        .attr('data-name', all)
                        .toggleClass('collapsed', collapsed);

     <p>This looks very close, to me!</p>
     <p>Here are some changes I recommend:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>After the end of your closing <code>&lt;/table&gt;</code> tag, there is an extra <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag. That looks incorrect - it should be removed. I don't think this causes any errors - but it is worth fixing.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>In your <code>rows.every()</code> function, the <code>data</code> variable is a plain array - for example:</p>
       <p>[ "IT", "Name 1", "Locations Here", "05/02/2021", "05/03/2021", "P", â€¦ ]</p></li>
     </ol>
     <p>Therefore you cannot use <code>data.MondayStatus</code> - because that will be <code>undefined</code>. Instead use something like <code>data[5]</code> to get the 6th item in the array (<code>P</code>).</p>
     <ol start="3">
      <li>
       <p>If you want to change the background color of a row for a location (e.g. "IT" or "OM"), you can use a selector like this:</p>
       <p>$("tr[data-name='IT'] td").addClass("green");</p></li>
     </ol>
     <p>This works because you have already added a custom attribute called <code>data-name</code> to the relevant <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> tag. The selector finds the <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> tag which is the child of the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> tag using that custom attribute.</p>
     <p>However, the problem here is: You are trying to assign the class to a table node <em>before</em> the DataTable has finished being built.</p>
     <p>To address this you can move all of that row looping logic to an <code>initComplete</code> function:</p>
     <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>initComplete: function(settings, json) {
  this.api().rows().every(function ( rowIdx, tableLoop, rowLoop ) {
    var data = this.data();
    var node = this.node().previousSibling; // to handle your row grouping
    if (node !== null) {
      if (data[5] === "P") {
        var selectorVar = "[data-name='" + data[0] + "'] td";                       
        $( selectorVar ).addClass("green");
      }
    }
  });
}
</code></pre>
     <p>Instead of <code>if (data[5] === "P")</code>, you can expand this logic to handle different values and also different class names (not just "green"), for whatever the overall logic is that you need. My logic is just a small demo to show the color change.</p>
     <hr>
     <p><strong>Update to handle "today"</strong></p>
     <p>To show the approach, let's assume the following record:</p>
     <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var data = {  
  "Department": "IT",
  "Name": "Name 1",
  "Locations": "Locations Here",
  "Sunday": "2021-05-09",
  "Monday": "2021-05-10",
  "MondayStatus": "P",
  "Tuesday": "2021-05-11",
  "TuesdayStatus": "Q",
  "Wednesday": "2021-05-12",
  "WednesdayStatus": "R",
  "Thursday": "2021-05-13",
  "ThursdayStatus": "S",
  "Friday": "2021-05-14",
  "FridayStatus": "T"
};
</code></pre>
     <p>This <code>data</code> variable is what I think you are handling in the <code>rows.every</code> function. So, it's the equivalent of <code>var data = this.data();</code>. I may have got some of the keys wrong (uppercase/lowercase) - but you can adjust the test data if that is the case.</p>
     <p>Now, I get today's date, formatted to match the same format as the dates in the <code>data</code> object:</p>
     <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var today = moment().format("YYYY-MM-DD"); // "2021-05-10"
</code></pre>
     <p>I use this value to find the equivalent value in the <code>data</code> variable, and I return the key name for that entry:</p>
     <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var result = Object.keys(data).find(key =&gt; data[key].substring(0,10) === today); // "Monday"
</code></pre>
     <p>This is basically a reverse-lookup from what you would normally do. Instead of starting with a key, we start with a value and end with a key - in this case, the key is the string "Friday".</p>
     <p>Now we take this string and append "Status" to it.</p>
     <p>This gives us an actual key string: "FridayStatus".</p>
     <p>Now we use that key to find the status for today (if it exists at all in the <code>data</code> object):</p>
     <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var todayStatus = result ? data[result + 'Status'] : 'n/a'; // "P"
</code></pre>
     <p>If the date does not exist, then you will end up with a status of "n/a".</p>
     <p>Overall, this gives us a quick way to get today's status, without having to perform lots of if/else logic.</p>
     <p>Once you have today's status you can use it in a smaller if/else to choose the required color you want to apply to the row.</p>
