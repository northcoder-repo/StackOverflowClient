     <pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~1
</code></pre>
     <p>The result is:</p>
     <pre><code> (F)
A-B
  ↑
master
</code></pre>
     <p>Now B is the HEAD. Because you used <code>--hard</code>, your files are reset to their state at commit B.</p>
     <h3>Option 2: <code>git reset</code></h3>
     <p>Maybe commit C wasn't a disaster, but just a bit off. You want to <strong>undo the commit but keep your changes</strong> for a bit of editing before you do a better commit. Starting again from here, with C as your HEAD:</p>
     <pre><code>   (F)
A-B-C
    ↑
  master
</code></pre>
     <p>Do this, leaving off the <code>--hard</code>:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset HEAD~1
</code></pre>
     <p>In this case the result is:</p>
     <pre><code>   (F)
A-B-C
  ↑
master
</code></pre>
     <p>In both cases, HEAD is just a pointer to the latest commit. When you do a <code>git reset HEAD~1</code>, you tell Git to move the HEAD pointer back one commit. But (unless you use <code>--hard</code>) you leave your files as they were. So now <code>git status</code> shows the changes you had checked into C. You haven't lost a thing!</p>
     <h3>Option 3: <code>git reset --soft</code></h3>
     <p>For the lightest touch, you can even <strong>undo your commit but leave your files and your <a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/WhatIsTheIndex" rel="noreferrer">index</a></strong>:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD~1
</code></pre>
     <p>This not only leaves your files alone, it even leaves your <em>index</em> alone. When you do <code>git status</code>, you'll see that the same files are in the index as before. In fact, right after this command, you could do <code>git commit</code> and you'd be redoing the same commit you just had.</p>
     <h3>Option 4: you did <code>git reset --hard</code> and need to get that code back</h3>
     <p>One more thing: Suppose you <strong>destroy a commit</strong> as in the first example, <strong>but then discover you needed it after all</strong>? Tough luck, right?</p>
     <p>Nope, there's <em>still</em> a way to get it back. Type this</p>
     <pre><code>git reflog
</code></pre>
     <p>and you'll see a list of (partial) commit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Data_integrity" rel="noreferrer">shas</a> (that is, hashes) that you've moved around in. Find the commit you destroyed, and do this:</p>
     <pre><code>git checkout -b someNewBranchName shaYouDestroyed
</code></pre>
     <p>You've now resurrected that commit. Commits don't actually get destroyed in Git for some 90 days, so you can usually go back and rescue one you didn't mean to get rid of.</p>

If you use git reset --soft HEAD~1, your branch pointer moves back to B, but your files and index stay at their versions in C. If you use git reset --mixed HEAD~1, your branch pointer and index move back to B, but your files stay in their state at C.

     <p>There are two ways to "undo" your last commit, depending on whether or not you have already made your commit public (pushed to your remote repository):</p>
     <h2>How to undo a local commit</h2>
     <p>Let's say I committed locally, but now I want to remove that commit.</p>
     <pre><code>git log
    commit 101: bad commit    # Latest commit. This would be called 'HEAD'.
    commit 100: good commit   # Second to last commit. This is the one we want.
</code></pre>
     <p>To restore everything back to the way it was prior to the last commit, we need to <code>reset</code> to the commit before <code>HEAD</code>:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD^     # Use --soft if you want to keep your changes
git reset --hard HEAD^     # Use --hard if you don't care about keeping the changes you made
</code></pre>
     <p>Now <code>git log</code> will show that our last commit has been removed.</p>
     <h2>How to undo a public commit</h2>
     <p>If you have already made your commits public, you will want to create a new commit which will "revert" the changes you made in your previous commit (current HEAD).</p>
     <pre><code>git revert HEAD
</code></pre>
     <p>Your changes will now be reverted and ready for you to commit:</p>
     <pre><code>git commit -m 'restoring the file I removed by accident'
git log
    commit 102: restoring the file I removed by accident
    commit 101: removing a file we don't need
    commit 100: adding a file that we need
</code></pre>

     <p>Add/remove files to get things the way you want:</p>
     <pre><code>git rm classdir
git add sourcedir
</code></pre>
     <p>Then amend the commit:</p>
     <pre><code>git commit --amend
</code></pre>
     <p>The previous, erroneous commit will be edited to reflect the new index state - in other words, it'll be like you never made the mistake in the first place.</p>
     <p>Note that you should only do this if you haven't pushed yet. If you have pushed, then you'll just have to commit a fix normally.</p>

     <h2 id="to-revert-a-commit-rotb">To revert a commit</h2>
     <p>Amending a commit is the ideal solution if you need to change the last commit, but a more general solution is <code>reset</code>.</p>
     <p>You can reset Git to any commit with:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset @~N
</code></pre>
     <p>Where <code>N</code> is the number of commits before <code>HEAD</code>, and <code>@~</code> resets to the previous commit.</p>
     <p>Instead of amending the commit, you could use:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset @~
git add *.java
git commit -m "Add .java files"
</code></pre>
     <p>Check out <code>git help reset</code>, specifically the sections on <code>--soft</code> <code>--mixed</code> and <code>--hard</code>, for a better understanding of what this does.</p>
     <h2 id="reflog-hdrm">Reflog</h2>
     <p>If you mess up, you can always use the reflog to find dropped commits:</p>
     <pre><code>$ git reset @~
$ git reflog
c4f708b HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to @~
2c52489 HEAD@{1}: commit: added some .class files
$ git reset 2c52489
... and you're back where you started

     <p>If you are planning to undo a local commit entirely, whatever you change you did on the commit, and if you don't worry anything about that, just do the following command.</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD^1
</code></pre>
     <p>(This command will ignore your entire commit and your changes will be lost completely from your local working tree). If you want to undo your commit, but you want your changes in the staging area (before commit just like after <code>git add</code>) then do the following command.</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD^1
</code></pre>
     <p>Now your committed files come into the staging area. Suppose if you want to upstage the files, because you need to edit some wrong content, then do the following command</p>
     <pre><code>git reset HEAD
</code></pre>
     <p>Now committed files to come from the staged area into the unstaged area. Now files are ready to edit, so whatever you change, you want to go edit and added it and make a fresh/new commit.</p>

     <p>I prefer to use <code>git rebase -i</code> for this job, because a nice list pops up where I can choose the commits to get rid of. It might not be as direct as some other answers here, but it just <em>feels right</em>.</p>
     <p>Choose how many commits you want to list, then invoke like this (to enlist last three)</p>
     <pre><code>git rebase -i HEAD~3
</code></pre>
     <p>Sample list</p>
     <pre><code>pick aa28ba7 Sanity check for RtmpSrv port
pick c26c541 RtmpSrv version option
pick 58d6909 Better URL decoding support

     <h2>How to fix the previous local commit</h2>
     <p>Use git-gui (or similar) to perform a <code>git commit --amend</code>. From the GUI you can add or remove individual files from the commit. You can also modify the commit message.</p>
     <h2>How to undo the previous local commit</h2>
     <p>Just reset your branch to the previous location (for example, using <code>gitk</code> or <code>git rebase</code>). Then reapply your changes from a saved copy. After garbage collection in your local repository, it will be like the unwanted commit never happened. To do all of that in a single command, use <code>git reset HEAD~1</code>.</p>
     <p><strong>Word of warning</strong>: <em>Careless use of <code>git reset</code> is a good way to get your working copy into a confusing state. I recommend that Git novices avoid this if they can.</em></p>
     <h2>How to undo a public commit</h2>
     <p>Perform a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1624724/86967">reverse cherry pick</a> (<a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert.html" rel="noreferrer">git-revert</a>) to undo the changes.</p>
     <p>If you haven't yet pulled other changes onto your branch, you can simply do...</p>
     <pre><code>git revert --no-edit HEAD
</code></pre>
     <p>Then push your updated branch to the shared repository.</p>

     <pre><code>git push --delete (branch_name) ## remove public version of branch

     <p>Just reset it doing the command below using <code>git</code>:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD~1
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>Explain:</strong> what <code>git reset</code> does, it's basically <code>reset</code> to any commit you'd like to go back to, then if you combine it with <code>--soft</code> key, it will go back, but keep the changes in your file(s), so you get back to the stage which the file was just added, <code>HEAD</code> is the head of the branch and if you combine with <code>~1</code> (in this case you also use <code>HEAD^</code>), it will go back only one commit which what you want...</p>

     <p><strong>How to undo the last Git commit?</strong></p>
     <p>To restore everything back to the way it was prior to the last commit, we need to reset to the commit before HEAD.</p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>If you don't want to keep your changes that you made:</p>
       <pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD^
</code></pre></li>
      <li>
       <p>If you want to keep your changes:</p>
       <pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD^
</code></pre></li>
     </ol>
     <p>Now check your git log. It will show that our last commit has been removed.</p>

     <p>Another way:</p>
     <p>Checkout the branch you want to revert, then reset your local working copy back to the commit that you want to be the latest one on the remote server (everything after it will go bye-bye). To do this, in SourceTree I right-clicked on the and selected "Reset BRANCHNAME to this commit".</p>
     <p>Then navigate to your repository's local directory and run this command:</p>
     <pre><code>git -c diff.mnemonicprefix=false -c core.quotepath=false push -v -f --tags REPOSITORY_NAME BRANCHNAME:BRANCHNAME
</code></pre>
     <p>This will erase all commits after the current one in your local repository but only for that one branch.</p>

     <h2>WHAT TO USE, <code>reset --soft</code> or <code>reset --hard</code>?</h2>
     <p>I am just adding two cents for @Kyralessa's answer:</p>
     <p>If you are unsure what to use go for <code>--soft</code> (I used this convention to remember it --<strong>s</strong>oft for safe).</p>
     <h3>Why?</h3>
     <p>If you choose <code>--hard</code> by mistake you will <strong>LOSE</strong> your changes as it wasn't before. If you choose <code>--soft</code> by mistake you can achieve the same results of <code>--hard</code> by applying additional commands</p>
     <pre><code>git reset HEAD file.html
git checkout -- file.html
</code></pre>
     <h3>Full example</h3>
     <pre><code>echo "some changes..." &gt; file.html
git add file.html
git commit -m "wrong commit"

# I need to reset
git reset --hard HEAD~1 (cancel changes)

     <p>There are many ways to do it:</p>
     <p>Git command to undo the last commit/ previous commits:</p>
     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Do Not use --hard if you do not know what you are doing. --hard is too <strong>dangerous</strong>, and it might <strong>delete your files.</strong></p>
     <p><strong>Basic command to revert the commit in Git is:</strong></p>
     <pre><code>$ git reset --hard &lt;COMMIT -ID&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>or</p>
     <pre><code>$ git reset --hard HEAD~&lt;n&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>COMMIT-ID</strong>: ID for the commit</p>
     <p><strong>n:</strong> is the number of last commits you want to revert</p>
     <p>You can get the commit id as shown below:</p>
     <pre><code>$ **git log --oneline**

d81d3f1 function to subtract two numbers

be20eb8 function to add two numbers

bedgfgg function to multiply two numbers
</code></pre>
     <p>where <strong>d81d3f1</strong> and <strong>be20eb8</strong> are commit id.</p>
     <p><strong>Now, let's see some cases:</strong></p>
     <p><em>Suppose you want to revert the last commit 'd81d3f1'. Here are two options:</em></p>
     <pre><code>$ git reset --hard d81d3f1
</code></pre>
     <p>or</p>
     <pre><code>$ git reset --hard HEAD~1
</code></pre>
     <p><em>Suppose you want to revert the commit 'be20eb8':</em></p>
     <pre><code>$ git reset --hard be20eb8
</code></pre>
     <p>For more detailed information, you can refer to and try out some other commands too for resetting the head to a specified state:</p>
     <pre><code>$ git reset --help
</code></pre>

     <h3>For a local commit</h3>
     <pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD~1
</code></pre>
     <p>or if you do not remember exactly in which commit it is, you might use</p>
     <pre><code>git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>
     <h3>For a pushed commit</h3>
     <p>The proper way of removing files from the repository history is using <code>git filter-branch</code>. That is,</p>
     <pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;' HEAD
</code></pre>
     <p>But I recomnend you use this command with care. Read more at <em><a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-filter-branch.html">git-filter-branch(1) Manual Page</a></em>.</p>

     <p>There are two main scenarios</p>
     <p><strong>You haven't pushed the commit yet</strong></p>
     <p>If the problem was extra files you commited (and you don't want those on repository), you can remove them using <code>git rm</code> and then commiting with <code>--amend</code></p>
     <pre><code>git rm &lt;pathToFile&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>You can also remove entire directories with <code>-r</code>, or even combine with other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29">Bash</a> commands</p>
     <pre><code>git rm -r &lt;pathToDirectory&gt;
git rm $(find -name '*.class')
</code></pre>
     <p>After removing the files, you can commit, with <strong>--amend</strong> option</p>
     <pre><code>git commit --amend -C HEAD # the -C option is to use the same commit message
</code></pre>
     <p>This will rewrite your recent local commit removing the extra files, so, these files will never be sent on push and also will be removed from your local .git repository by GC.</p>
     <p><strong>You already pushed the commit</strong></p>
     <p>You can apply the same solution of the other scenario and then doing <code>git push</code> with the <code>-f</code> option, but it is <strong>not recommended</strong> since it overwrites the remote history with a divergent change (it can mess your repository).</p>
     <p>Instead, you have to do the commit without <code>--amend</code> (remember this about -amend`: That option rewrites the history on the last commit).</p>

     <p>Think we have <strong><em>code.txt</em></strong> file. We make some changes on it and commit. <strong>We can undo this commit in three ways</strong>, but first you should know what is the staged file... An staged file is a file that ready to commit and if you run <code>git status</code> this file will be shown with green color and if this is not staged for commit will be shown with red color:</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ymNKl.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/927358/ymNKl.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
     <p>It means if you commit your change, your changes on this file is not saved. You can add this file in your stage with <code>git add code.txt</code> and then commit your change:</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/36Yag.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/927358/36Yag.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
     <p><strong>Undo last commit:</strong></p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>Now if we want to just undo commit without any other changes, we can use</p>
       <p><code>git reset --soft HEAD^</code></p>
       <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tx6x1.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/927358/Tx6x1.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p></li>
      <li>
       <p>If we want to undo commit and its changes (<strong><em>THIS IS DANGEROUS, because your change will lost</em></strong>), we can use</p>
       <p><code>git reset --hard HEAD^</code></p>
       <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8NDBS.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/927358/8NDBS.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p></li>
      <li>
       <p>And if we want to undo commit and remove changes from stage, we can use</p>
       <p><code>git reset --mixed HEAD^</code> or in a short form <code>git reset HEAD^</code></p>

     <p>Usually, you want to <strong>undo</strong> a commit because you made a mistake and you want to fix it - essentially what the OP did when he asked the question. Really, you actually want to <strong>redo</strong> a commit.</p>
     <p>Most of the answers here focus on the command line. While the command line is the best way to use Git when you're comfortable with it, its probably a bit alien to those coming from other version control systems to Git.</p>
     <p>Here's how to do it using a GUI. If you have Git installed, you already have everything you need to follow these instructions.</p>
     <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I will assume here that you realised the commit was wrong before you pushed it. If you don't know what pushing means, then you probably haven't pushed. Carry on with the instructions. If you have pushed the faulty commit, the least risky way is just to follow up the faulty commit with a new commit that fixes things, the way you would do it in a version control system that does not allow you to rewrite history.</p>
     <p>That said, here's how to fix your most recent fault commit using a GUI:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Navigate to your repository on the command line and start the GUI with <code>git gui</code></li>
      <li>Choose "Amend last commit". You will see your last commit message, the files you staged and the files you didn't.</li>
      <li>Now change things to how you want them to look and click Commit.</li>

     <p><strong>Undo the Last Commit</strong></p>
     <p>There are tons of situations where you really want to undo that last commit into your code. E.g. because you'd like to restructure it extensively - or even discard it altogether!</p>
     <p>In these cases, the "reset" command is your best friend:</p>
     <pre><code>$ git reset --soft HEAD~1
</code></pre>
     <p>The above command (reset) will rewind your current HEAD branch to the specified revision. In our example above, we'd like to return to the one before the current revision - effectively making our last commit undone.</p>
     <p>Note the <code>--soft</code> flag: this makes sure that the changes in undone revisions are preserved. After running the command, you'll find the changes as uncommitted local modifications in your working copy.</p>
     <p>If you don't want to keep these changes, simply use the <code>--hard</code> flag. Be sure to only do this when you're sure you don't need these changes any more.</p>
     <pre><code>$ git reset --hard HEAD~1
</code></pre>

     <p>Before answering let's add some background, explaining what is this <code>HEAD</code>.</p>
     <h1><strong><em><code>First of all what is HEAD?</code></em></strong></h1>
     <p><code>HEAD</code> is simply a reference to the current commit (latest) on the current branch.<br>
       There can only be a single <code>HEAD</code> at any given time. (excluding <code>git worktree</code>)</p>
     <p>The content of <code>HEAD</code> is stored inside <code>.git/HEAD</code> and it contains the 40 bytes SHA-1 of the current commit.</p>
     <hr>
     <h1><strong><em><code>detached HEAD</code></em></strong></h1>
     <p>If you are not on the latest commit - meaning that <code>HEAD</code> is pointing to a prior commit in history its called <strong><em><code>detached HEAD</code></em></strong>.</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OlavO.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/927358/OlavO.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
     <p>On the command line, it will look like this- SHA-1 instead of the branch name since the <code>HEAD</code> is not pointing to the tip of the current branch</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qplvo.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/927358/qplvo.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

git checkout HEAD~X // x is the number of commits t go back
</code></pre>
     <p>This will checkout new branch pointing to the desired commit.<br>
       This command will checkout to a given commit.<br>
       At this point, you can create a branch and start to work from this point on.</p>
     <pre><code># Checkout a given commit. 
# Doing so will result in a `detached HEAD` which mean that the `HEAD`
# is not pointing to the latest so you will need to checkout branch
# in order to be able to update the code.
git checkout &lt;commit-id&gt;

# create a new branch forked to the given commit
git checkout -b &lt;branch name&gt;

     <p>In my case I committed and pushed to the wrong branch, so what I wanted was to have all my changes back so I can commit them to a new correct branch, so I did this:</p>
     <p>On the same branch that you committed and pushed, if you type "git status" you won't see anything new because you committed and pushed, now type:</p>
     <pre><code>    git reset --soft HEAD~1
</code></pre>
     <p>This will get all your changes(files) back in the stage area, now to get them back in the working directory(unstage) you just type:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset FILE
</code></pre>
     <p>Where "File" is the file that you want to commit again. Now, this FILE should be in the working directory(unstaged) with all the changes that you did. Now you can change to whatever branch that you want and commit the changes in that branch. Of course, the initial branch that you committed is still there with all changes, but in my case that was ok, if it is not for you-you can look for ways to revert that commit in that branch.</p>

     <p>To undo your local commit you use <code>git reset &lt;commit&gt;</code>. Also <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-reset" rel="noreferrer">that tutorial</a> is very helpful to show you how it works.</p>
     <p>Alternatively, you can use <code>git revert &lt;commit&gt;</code>: <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-revert/" rel="noreferrer">reverting</a> should be used when you want to add another commit that rolls back the changes (but keeps them in the project history).</p>

     <p>Suppose you made a wrong commit locally and pushed it to a remote repository. You can undo the mess with these two commands:</p>
     <p>First, we need to correct our local repository by going back to the commit that we desire:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard &lt;previous good commit id where you want the local repository  to go&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>Now we forcefully push this good commit on the remote repository by using this command:</p>
     <pre><code>git push --force-with-lease
</code></pre>
     <p>The 'with-lease' version of the force option it will prevent accidental deletion of new commits you do not know about (i.e. coming from another source since your last pull).</p>

     <p>If you want to remove the last commit from your branch, the simplest way to do it is:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~1

     <p>Now to actually push that change to get rid of your last commit, you have to</p>

     <h3>A Typical Git Cycle</h3>
     <p>In speaking of Git-related commands in the previous answers, I would like to share my typical Git cycles with all readers which may helpful. Here is how I work with Git,</p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>Cloning the first time from the remote server</p>
       <p><code>git clone $project</code></p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Pulling from remote (when I don't have a pending local commit to push)</p>
       <p><code>git pull</code></p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Adding a new local file1 into $to_be_committed_list (just imagine $to_be_committed_list means <code>staged</code> area)</p>
       <p><code>git add $file1</code></p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Removing mistakenly added file2 from $to_be_committed_list (assume that file2 is added like step 3, which I didn't want)</p>
       <p><code>git reset $file2</code></p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Committing file1 which is in $to_be_committed_list</p>
       <p><code>git commit -m "commit message description"</code></p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Syncing local commit with remote repository before pushing</p>
       <p><code>git pull --rebase</code></p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Resolving when conflict occurs <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration" rel="noreferrer">prerequisite configure mergetool</a></p>
       <p><code>git mergetool #resolve merging here, also can manually merge</code></p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Adding conflict-resolved files, let's say <code>file1</code>:</p>
       <p><code>git add $file1</code></p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Continuing my previous rebase command</p>
       <p><code>git rebase --continue</code></p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Pushing ready and already synced last local commit</p>
       <p><code>git push origin head:refs/for/$branch # branch = master, dev, etc.</code></p></li>
     </ol>

     <p>In these cases, the "reset" command is your best friend:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD~1
</code></pre>
     <p>Reset will rewind your current HEAD branch to the specified revision. In our example above, we'd like to return to the one before the current revision - effectively making our last commit undone.</p>
     <p>Note the --soft flag: this makes sure that the changes in undone revisions are preserved. After running the command, you'll find the changes as uncommitted local modifications in your working copy.</p>
     <p>If you don't want to keep these changes, simply use the --hard flag. Be sure to only do this when you're sure you don't need these changes anymore.</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~1
</code></pre>

     <p>In order to get rid of (all the changes in) last commit, last 2 commits and last n commits:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~1
git reset --hard HEAD~2
...
git reset --hard HEAD~n
</code></pre>
     <p>And, to get rid of anything after a specific commit:</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard &lt;commit sha&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>e.g.,</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard 0d12345
</code></pre>
     <p>Be careful with the hard option: it deletes the local changes in your repo as well and reverts to the previous mentioned commit. You should only run this if you are sure you messed up in your last commit(s) and would like to go back in time.</p>
     <p>As a side-note, about 7 letters of the commit hash is enough, but in bigger projects, you may need up to 12 letters for it to be unique. You can also use the entire commit SHA if you prefer.</p>
     <p>The above commands work in GitHub for Windows as well.</p>

    <div>
     <p>In order to remove some files from a Git commit, use the “git reset” command with the “–soft” option and specify the commit before HEAD.</p>
     <pre><code>$ git reset --soft HEAD~1
</code></pre>
     <p>When running this command, you will be presented with the files from the most recent commit (HEAD) and you will be able to commit them.</p>
     <p>Now that your files are in the staging area, you can remove them (or unstage them) using the “git reset” command again.</p>
     <pre><code>$ git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>Note: this time, you are resetting from HEAD as you simply want to exclude files from your staging area</p>
     <p>If you are simply not interested in this file any more, you can use the “git rm” command in order to delete the file from the index (also called the staging area).</p>
     <pre><code>$ git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>When you are done with the modifications, you can simply commit your changes again with the “–amend” option.</p>
     <pre><code>$ git commit --amend
</code></pre>
     <p>To verify that the files were correctly removed from the repository, you can run the “git ls-files” command and check that the file does not appear in the file (if it was a new one of course)</p>
     <pre><code>$ git ls-files

 &lt;file1&gt;
 &lt;file2&gt;
</code></pre>
     <h3>Remove a File From a Commit using Git Restore</h3>
     <p>Since Git 2.23, there is a new way to remove files from commit, but you will have to make sure that you are using a Git version greater or equal than 2.23.</p>
     <pre><code>$ git --version
</code></pre>
     <p>Git version 2.24.1</p>
     <p>Note: Git 2.23 was released in August 2019 and you may not have this version already available on your computer.</p>
     <p>To install newer versions of Git, you can check this tutorial. To remove files from commits, use the “git restore” command, specify the source using the “–source” option and the file to be removed from the repository.</p>
     <p>For example, in order to remove the file named “myfile” from the HEAD, you would write the following command</p>
     <pre><code>$ git restore --source=HEAD^ --staged  -- &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>As an example, let’s pretend that you edited a file in your most recent commit on your “master” branch.</p>
     <p>The file is correctly committed but you want to remove it from your Git repository.</p>
     <p>To remove your file from the Git repository, you want first to restore it.</p>
     <pre><code>$ git restore --source=HEAD^ --staged  -- newfile

$ git status
</code></pre>
     <h3>On branch 'master'</h3>
     <p>Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit. (use "git push" to publish your local commits)</p>
     <p>Changes to be committed:</p>
     <pre><code> (use "git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
    modified:   newfile
</code></pre>
     <p>Changes not staged for commit:</p>
     <pre><code> (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
 (use "git restore &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
      modified:   newfile
</code></pre>
     <p>As you can see, your file is back to the staging area.</p>
     <p>From there, you have two choices, you can choose to edit your file in order to re-commit it again, or to simply delete it from your Git repository.</p>
     <h3>Remove a File from a Git Repository</h3>
     <p>In this section, we are going to describe the steps in order to remove the file from your Git repository.</p>
     <p>First, you need to unstage your file as you won’t be able to remove it if it is staged.</p>
     <p>To unstage a file, use the “git reset” command and specify the HEAD as source.</p>
     <pre><code>$ git reset HEAD newfile
</code></pre>
     <p>When your file is correctly unstaged, use the “git rm” command with the “–cached” option in order to remove this file from the Git index (this won’t delete the file on disk)</p>
     <pre><code>$ git rm --cached newfile
</code></pre>
     <p>rm 'newfile'</p>
     <p>Now if you check the repository status, you will be able to see that Git staged a deletion commit.</p>
     <pre><code>$ git status
</code></pre>
     <h3>On branch 'master'</h3>
     <p>Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit. (use "git push" to publish your local commits)</p>
     <p>Changes to be committed:</p>
     <pre><code> (use "git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
    deleted:    newfile
</code></pre>
     <p>Now that your file is staged, simply use the “git commit” with the “–amend” option in order to amend the most recent commit from your repository.</p>
     <pre><code>`$ git commit --amend

 [master 90f8bb1] Commit from HEAD
  Date: Fri Dec 20 03:29:50 2019 -0500
  1 file changed, 2 deletions(-)
  delete mode 100644 newfile
</code></pre>
     <p>`As you can see, this won’t create a new commit but it will essentially modify the most recent commit in order to include your changes.</p>
     <h3>Remove a Specific File from a Git Commit</h3>
     <p>In some cases, you don’t want all the files to be staged again: you only one to modify one very specific file of your repository.</p>
     <p>In order to remove a specific file from a Git commit, use the “git reset” command with the “–soft” option, specify the commit before HEAD and the file that you want to remove.</p>
     <pre><code>$ git reset HEAD^ -- &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>When you are done with the modifications, your file will be back in the staging area.</p>
     <p>First, you can choose to remove the file from the staging area by using the “git reset” command and specify that you want to reset from the HEAD.</p>
     <pre><code>$ git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>Note: it does not mean that you will lose the changes on this file, just that the file will be removed from the staging area.</p>
     <p>If you want to completely remove the file from the index, you will have to use the “git rm” command with the “–cached” option.</p>
     <pre><code>$ git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>In order to make sure that your file was correctly removed from the staging area, use the “git ls-files” command to list files that belong to the index.</p>
     <pre><code>$ git ls-files
</code></pre>
     <p>When you are completely done with your modifications, you can amend the commit you removed the files from by using the “git commit” command with the “–amend” option.</p>
     <pre><code>$ git commit --amend
</code></pre>

     <p>You can undo your Git commits in two ways: First is you can use <code>git revert</code>, if you want to keep your commit history:</p>
     <pre><code>git revert HEAD~3
git revert &lt;hashcode of commit&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>Second is you can use <code>git reset</code>, which would delete all your commit history and bring your head to commit where you want it.</p>
     <pre><code>git reset &lt;hashcode of commit&gt;
git reset HEAD~3
</code></pre>
     <p>You can also use the <code>--hard</code> keyword if any of it starts behaving otherwise. But, I would only recommend it until it's extremely necessary.</p>

     <p>Reset will rewind your current HEAD branch to the specified revision.</p>
     <p><strong>Note</strong> the <code>--soft</code> flag: this makes sure that the changes in undone revisions are preserved. After running the command, you'll find the changes as uncommitted local modifications in your working copy.</p>
     <p>If you don't want to keep these changes, simply use the <code>--hard</code> flag. Be sure to only do this when you're sure you don't need these changes anymore.</p>

     <h3>Undoing a series of local commits</h3>
     <blockquote>
      <p>OP: How do I undo the most recent local commits in Git? I accidentally committed the wrong files [as part of several commits].</p>
     </blockquote>
     <h4>Start case</h4>
     <p>There are several ways to "undo" as series of commits, depending on the outcome you're after. Considering the start case below, <code>reset</code>, <code>rebase</code> and <code>filter-branch</code> can all be used to rewrite your history.</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CtqYJ.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/927358/CtqYJ.png" alt="Star-case"></a></p>
     <p><em><strong>How can <em>C1</em> and <em>C2</em> be undone to remove the <code>tmp.log</code> file from each commit?</strong></em></p>
     <p>In the examples below, absolute commit references are used, but it works the same way if you're more used to relative references (i.e. <code>HEAD~2</code> or <code>HEAD@{n}</code>).</p>
     <h4>Alternative 1: <code>reset</code></h4>
     <pre><code>$ git reset --soft t56pi
</code></pre>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UEmaO.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/927358/UEmaO.png" alt="using-reset"></a></p>
     <p>With <code>reset</code>, a branch can be reset to a previous state, and any compounded changes be reverted to the <em>Staging Area</em>, from where any unwanted changes can then be discarded.</p>
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> As <code>reset</code> clusters all previous changes into the <em>Staging Area</em>, individual commit meta-data is lost. If this is not OK with you, chances are you're probably better off with <code>rebase</code> or <code>filter-branch</code> instead.</p>
     <h4>Alternative 2: <code>rebase</code></h4>
     <pre><code>$ git rebase --interactive t56pi
</code></pre>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h4IuR.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/927358/h4IuR.png" alt="using-rebase"></a></p>
     <p>Using an interactive <code>rebase</code> each offending commit in the branch can be rewritten, allowing you to modify and discard unwanted changes. In the infographic above, the source tree on the right illustrates the state post <code>rebase</code>.</p>
     <p><strong>Step-by-step</strong></p>
     <ol>
      <li>Select from which commit the rebase should be based (e.g. <code>t56pi</code>)</li>
      <li>Select which commits you'd like to change by replacing <code>pick</code> with <code>edit</code>. Save and close.</li>
      <li>Git will now stop on each selected commit allowing you to reset <code>HEAD</code>, remove the unwanted files, and create brand new commits.</li>
     </ol>
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> With <code>rebase</code> much of the commit meta data is kept, in contrast to the <code>reset</code> alternative above. This is most likely a preferred option, if you want to keep much of your history but only remove the unwanted files.</p>
     <h4>Alternative 3: <code>filter-branch</code></h4>
     <pre><code>$ git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -r ./tmp.log' t56pi..HEAD
</code></pre>
     <p>Above command would filter out the file <code>./tmp.log</code> from all commits in the desired range <code>t56pi..HEAD</code> (assuming our initial start case from above). See below illustration for clarity.</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K0CSV.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/927358/K0CSV.png" alt="using-filter-branch"></a></p>
     <p>Similar to <code>rebase</code>, <code>filter-branch</code> can be used to wipe unwanted files from a subsection of a branch. Instead of manually editing each commit through the rebase process, <code>filter-branch</code> can automatically preformed the desired action on each commit.</p>
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> Just like <code>rebase</code>, <code>filter-branch</code> would preserve the rest of the commit meta-data, by only discarding the desired file. Notice how <em>C1</em> and <em>C2</em> have been rewritten, and the log-file discarded from each commit.</p>
     <h4>Conclusion</h4>
     <p>Just like anything related to software development, there are multiple ways to achieve the same (or similar) outcome for a give problem. You just need to pick the one most suitable for your particular case.</p>
     <h4>Finally - a friendly advice</h4>
     <p>Do note that all three alternatives above rewrites the history completely. Unless you know exactly what you're doing and have good communication within your team - only rewrite commits that have not yet been published remotely!</p>

     <p>For sake of completeness, I will give the one glaringly obvious method that was overlooked by the previous answers.</p>
     <p>Since the commit was not pushed, the remote was unchanged, so:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Delete the local repository.</li>
      <li>Clone the remote repository.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>This is sometimes necessary if your fancy Git client goes bye-bye (looking at you, egit).</p>
     <p>Don't forget to re-commit your <em>saved</em> changes since the last push.</p>

     <p>You can undo your commits from the local repository. Please follow the below scenario.</p>
     <p>In the below image I check out the 'test' branch (using Git command <code>git checkout -b test</code>) as a local and check status (using Git command <code>git status</code>) of local branch that there is nothing to commit.</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kQ0Ds.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/927358/kQ0Ds.png" alt="Enter image description here"></a></p>
     <p>In the next image image you can see here I made a few changes in <strong>Filter1.txt</strong> and added that file to the staging area and then committed my changes with some message (using Git command <code>git commit -m "Doing commit to test revert back"</code>).</p>
     <p><strong>"-m is for commit message"</strong></p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OpWzO.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/927358/OpWzO.png" alt="Enter image description here"></a></p>
     <p>In the next image you can see your commits log whatever you have made commits (using Git command <code>git log</code>).</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2keAh.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/927358/2keAh.png" alt="Enter image description here"></a></p>
     <p>So in the above image you can see the commit id with each commit and with your commit message now whatever commit you want to revert back or undo copy that commit id and hit the below Git command, <code>git revert {"paste your commit id"}</code>. Example:</p>
     <pre><code>git revert 9ca304ed12b991f8251496b4ea452857b34353e7
</code></pre>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mi04t.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/927358/mi04t.png" alt="Enter image description here"></a></p>
     <p>I have reverted back my last commit. Now if you check your Git status, you can see the modified file which is <strong>Filter1.txt</strong> and yet to commit.</p>

     <h1>The difference between git reset --mixed, --soft and --hard</h1>
     <blockquote>
      <p>Prerequisite: When a modification to an existing file in your repository is made, this change is initially considered as unstaged. In order to commit the changes, it needs to be staged which means adding it to the index using <code>git add</code>. During a commit operation, the files that are staged gets added to an index.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>Let's take an example:</p>
     <pre><code>- A - B - C (master)
</code></pre>
     <p><code>HEAD</code> points to <code>C</code> and the index matches <code>C</code>.</p>
     <h2>--soft</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>When we execute <code>git reset --soft B</code> with the intention of <strong>removing the commit C</strong> and <strong>pointing the master/HEAD to B</strong>.</li>
      <li>The master/HEAD will now point to B, but the <strong>index still has changed from C</strong>.</li>
      <li>When executing <code>git status</code> you could see the files indexed in <strong>commit C</strong> as <strong>staged</strong>.</li>
      <li>Executing a <code>git commit</code> at this point will create a new commit with <strong>the same changes as C</strong></li>
     </ul>
     <h2>--mixed</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>Execute <code>git reset --mixed B</code>.</li>
      <li>On execution, master/HEAD will point to B and the <strong>index is also modified to match B</strong> because of the mixed flag used.</li>
      <li>If we run git commit at this point, nothing will happen since the <strong>index matches HEAD</strong>.</li>
      <li>We still have the changes in the working directory, but since they're not in the index, <strong>git status shows them as unstaged</strong>.</li>
      <li>To commit them, you would <code>git add</code> and then commit as usual.</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>--hard</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>Execute <code>git reset --hard B</code></li>
      <li>On execution, master/HEAD will point to B <strong>and modifies your working directory</strong></li>
      <li>The <strong>changes added in C</strong> and <strong>all the uncommitted changes</strong> will be <strong>removed</strong>.</li>
      <li>Files in the working copy will match the commit B, this will result in loosing permanently all changes which were made in commit C plus uncommitted changes</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Hope this comparison of flags that are available to use with <code>git reset</code> command will help someone to use them wisely.

     <p>Before answering, let's add some background, explaining what this <code>HEAD</code> is.</p>
     <h1><em><strong><code>First of all what is HEAD?</code></strong></em></h1>
     <p><code>HEAD</code> is simply a reference to the current commit (latest) on the current branch. <br>
       There can only be a single <code>HEAD</code> at any given time (excluding <code>git worktree</code>).</p>
     <p>The content of <code>HEAD</code> is stored inside <code>.git/HEAD</code> and it contains the 40 bytes SHA-1 of the current commit.</p>

     <h1><em><strong><code>detached HEAD</code></strong></em></h1>
     <p>If you are not on the latest commit - meaning that <code>HEAD</code> is pointing to a prior commit in history it's called <em><strong><code>detached HEAD</code></strong></em>.</p>

     <p>This will checkout the new branch pointing to the desired commit. <br>
       This command will checkout to a given commit. <br>
       At this point, you can create a branch and start to work from this point on.</p>
     <pre><code># Checkout a given commit.

     <p>I validate an efficient method proposed, and here is a concrete example using it:</p>
     <p>In case you want to permanently undo/cancel your last commit (and so on, one by one, as many as you want) three steps:</p>
     <p>1: Get the id = SHA of the commit you want to arrive on with, of course</p>
     <pre><code>$ git log
</code></pre>
     <p>2: Delete your previous commit with</p>
     <pre><code>$ git reset --hard 'your SHA'
</code></pre>
     <p>3: Force the new local history upon your origin GitHub with the <code>-f</code> option (the last commit track will be erased from the GitHub history)</p>
     <pre><code>$ git push origin master -f
</code></pre>

     <p><strong>HEAD:</strong></p>
     <p>Before reset commit we should know about HEAD... HEAD is nothing but your current state in your working directory. It is represented by a commit number.</p>
     <p><strong>Git commit:</strong></p>
     <p>Each change assigned under a commit which is represented by a unique tag. Commits can't be deleted. So if you want your last commit, you can simply dive into it using <code>git reset</code>.</p>
     <p>You can dive into the last commit using two methods:</p>
     <p><strong>Method 1:</strong> (if you don't know the commit number, but want to move onto the very first)</p>
     <pre><code>git reset HEAD~1  # It will move your head to last commit
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>Method 2:</strong> (if you know the commit you simply reset onto your known commit)</p>
     <p><code>git reset 0xab3</code> # Commit number</p>
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> if you want to know a recent commit try <code>git log -p -1</code></p>
     <p>Here is the graphical representation:</p>

     <p>If you would like to eliminate the wrong files you should do</p>
     <p><code>git reset --soft &lt;your_last_good_commit_hash_here&gt;</code> Here, if you do <code>git status</code>, you will see the files in the staging area. You can select the wrong files and take them down from the staging area.</p>
     <p>Like the following.</p>
     <p><code>git reset wrongFile1 wrongFile2 wrongFile3</code></p>
     <p>You can now just add the files that you need to push,</p>
     <p><code>git add goodFile1 goodFile2</code></p>
     <p>Commit them</p>
     <p><code>git commit -v</code> or <code>git commit -am "Message"</code></p>
     <p>And push</p>
     <p><code>git push origin master</code></p>
     <p>However, if you do not care about the changed files you can hard reset to previous good commit and push everything to the server.</p>
     <p>By</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard &lt;your_last_good_commit_hash_here&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p><code>git push origin master</code></p>
     <p>If you already published your wrong files to the server, you can use the <code>--force</code> flag to push to the server and edit the history.</p>

     <p>Rebasing and dropping commits are the best when you want to keep the history clean useful when proposing patches to a public branch etc.</p>
     <p>If you have to drop the topmost commit then the following one-liner helps</p>
     <pre><code>git rebase --onto HEAD~1 HEAD
</code></pre>
     <p>But if you want to drop 1 of many commits you did say</p>
     <p>a -&gt; b -&gt; c -&gt; d -&gt; master</p>
     <p>and you want to drop commit 'c'</p>
     <pre><code>git rebase --onto b c
</code></pre>
     <p>This will make 'b' as the new base of 'd' eliminating 'c'</p>

     <p>Before picking specific tools (commands), please pick what you need rather than blindly running commands.</p>
     <h2>Amending the commit</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>Just in case you want to <em><strong>edit your last commit</strong></em>, there is a command.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p><strong>Advantage:</strong> It allows you to correct the last commit's message as well as add more changes to it.</p>
       <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>git commit --amend
</code></pre></li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Resetting the Commit</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>Really want to <strong>undo the last commit</strong> (because of massive changes or you want to discard it all).</p></li>
      <li>
       <p><strong>Advantage:</strong> The reset command will return to the one before the current revision, effectively making the last commit undone.</p></li>
     </ul>
     <p><strong>A. Soft Reset</strong></p>
     <p><strong>Advantage:</strong> A soft flag. It guarantees the preservation of modifications made in undone revisions. The changes appear in your working copy as uncommitted local modifications once you run the command.</p>
     <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>git reset --soft HEAD~1
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>B. Hard Reset</strong></p>
     <p><strong>Advantage:</strong> If you don't want to keep these changes, simply use the <code>--hard</code> flag. Be sure to only do this when you're sure you don't need these changes anymore.</p>
     <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>git reset --hard HEAD~1
</code></pre>
     <h2>Undo last commit but keep changes made to the files</h2>
     <p><strong>Advantage:</strong></p>
     <p>This command will tell Git to advance the HEAD pointer back one commit. The files' modifications won't be impacted, though. Now, if you run <code>git status</code>, you ought to still be able to view the local file changes.</p>
     <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>git reset HEAD~1
</code></pre>
     <p>Use according to your needs.</p>

     <p>Assuming you're working in Visual Studio, if you go in to your branch history and look at all of your commits, simply select the event prior to the commit you want to undo, right-click it, and select <code>Revert</code>. Easy as that.</p>

     <p>To undo the last local commit, without throwing away its changes, I have this handy alias in <code>~/.gitconfig</code></p>
     <pre><code>[alias]
  undo = reset --soft HEAD^
</code></pre>
     <p>Then I simply use <code>git undo</code> which is super-easy to remember.</p>

     <p>Replace your local version, including your changes with the server version. These two lines of code will force Git to pull and overwrite local.</p>
     <p>Open a command prompt and navigate to the Git project root. If you use Visual Studio, click on <em>Team</em>, <em>Sync</em> and click on "Open Command Prompt" (see the image) below.</p>

     <p>Once in the Cmd prompt, go ahead with the following two instructions.</p>
     <pre><code>git fetch --all

     <p>Then you do</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard origin/master

     <p><em><a href="https://ao.ms/how-to-delete-revert-a-git-commit/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">How to delete/revert a Git commit</a></em></p>
     <p>Basically you just need to do:</p>
     <p><code>git log</code>, get the first seven characters of the SHA hash, and then do a <code>git revert &lt;sha&gt;</code> followed by <code>git push --force</code>.</p>
     <p>You can also revert this by using the Git revert command as follows: <code>git revert &lt;sha&gt; -m -1</code> and then <code>git push</code>.</p>

     <p>Make sure you have a backup of your changes just in case, as it's a hard reset, which means they'll be lost (unless you stashed earlier)</p>

     <p>You'll encounter this problem:</p>

Use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:

     <p>The error occurs because if the last commit is the initial commit (or no parents) of the repository, there is no HEAD~.</p>

     <p><strong>If you have made local commits that you don't like, and they have not been pushed yet you can reset things back to a previous good commit. It will be as if the bad commits never happened. Here's how:</strong></p>
     <p>In your terminal (Terminal, Git Bash, or Windows Command Prompt), navigate to the folder for your Git repo. Run git status and make sure you have a clean working tree. Each commit has a unique hash (which looks something like 2f5451f). You need to find the hash for the last good commit (the one you want to revert back to). Here are two places you can see the hash for commits: In the commit history on GitHub or Bitbucket or website. In your terminal (Terminal, Git Bash, or Windows Command Prompt) run the command git log --online Once you know the hash for the last good commit (the one you want to revert back to), run the following command (replacing 2f5451f with your commit's hash):</p>
     <pre><code>git reset 2f5451f
git reset --hard 2f5451f
</code></pre>
     <p>NOTE: <em>If you do git reset the commits will be removed, but the changes will appear as uncommitted, giving you access to the code. This is the safest option because maybe you wanted some of that code and you can now make changes and new commits that are good. Often though you'll want to undo the commits and throw away the code, which is what git reset --hard does.</em></p>

     <p>This will generate the opposite changes from the commit which you want to revert back, and then just commit that changes. I think this is the simplest way.</p>

     <h3>How to <em>edit</em> an earlier commit</h3>
     <p>Generally I don't want to undo a bunch of commits, but rather edit an earlier commit to how I wish I had committed it in the first place.</p>
     <p>I found myself fixing a past commit frequently enough that I wrote a script for it.</p>
     <p>Here's the workflow:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <pre><code>git commit-edit &lt;commit-hash&gt;
</code></pre>
       <p>This will drop you at the commit you want to edit.</p>
       <p>The changes of the commit will be <strong>un</strong>staged, ready to be staged as you wish it was the first time.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Fix and stage the commit as you wish it had been in the first place.</p>
       <p>(You may want to use <code>git stash save --keep-index</code> to squirrel away any files you're not committing)</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Redo the commit with <code>--amend</code>, eg:</p>
       <pre><code>git commit --amend
</code></pre></li>
      <li>
       <p>Complete the rebase:</p>
       <pre><code>git rebase --continue
</code></pre></li>
     </ol>
     <hr>
     <p>Call this following <code>git-commit-edit</code> and put it in your <code>$PATH</code>:</p>
     <pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>#!/bin/bash

# Do an automatic git rebase --interactive, editing the specified commit

     <p>It’s important to understand that when you’re amending your last commit, you’re not so much fixing it as replacing it entirely with a new, improved commit that pushes the old commit out of the way and puts the new commit in its place. Effectively, it’s as if the previous commit never happened, and it won’t show up in your repository history.</p>
     <p>The obvious value to amending commits is to make minor improvements to your last commit, without cluttering your repository history with commit messages of the form, “Oops, forgot to add a file” or “Darn, fixing a typo in last commit”.</p>

     <p>It looks like this: <code>commit {long_hash}</code></p>
     <p>Copy this <code>long_hash</code> and reset to it (go back to same files/state it was on that commit):</p>

     <p>If the repository has been committed locally and not yet pushed to the server, another crude/layman way of solving it would be:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Git clone the repository in another location.</li>
      <li>Copy the modifications (files/directories) from the original repository into this new one. Then commit and push with the changes from the new one.</li>
      <li>Replace the old repository with this new one.</li>

     <p>If you have committed changes to Git, but have not yet pushed those changes to the remote repository, you can use the <code>git reset</code> command to undo those commits from your local repository.</p>
     <p>Here's how:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>Use the git log command to find the commit hash of the commit that you want to undo. The commit hash is a long string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies the commit. You can copy the commit hash to your clipboard by highlighting it and pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> on Windows or <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> on macOS.</p>
       <pre><code>git log
commit 1234567890abcdefg
Author: Your Name &lt;your.email@example.com&gt;
Date:   Mon Feb 21 13:42:24 2022 -0500

   Commit message goes here
</code></pre></li>
      <li>
       <p>Use the git reset command with the <code>--hard</code> option and the commit hash that you want to reset to. This will remove all the commits after the specified commit from your local repository, including any changes made in those commits.</p>
       <pre><code>git reset --hard 1234567890abcdefg
</code></pre>
       <p>Note that the <code>--hard</code> option will permanently delete any changes that you have made since the specified commit. If you want to keep your changes as unstaged changes in your working directory, you can use the <code>--soft</code> option instead of <code>--hard</code>.</p>
       <pre><code>git reset --soft 1234567890abcdefg
</code></pre></li>
      <li>
       <p>After running the <code>git reset</code> command, you can use the <code>git log</code> command again to verify that the unwanted commits have been removed from your local repository.</p>
       <pre><code>$ git log
commit 1234567890abcdefg
Author: Your Name &lt;your.email@example.com&gt;
Date:   Mon Feb 21 13:42:24 2022 -0500

    Commit message goes here
</code></pre></li>
     </ol>
     <p>If the unwanted commits are no longer in the log, you have successfully removed them from your local repository.</p>

     <p>You can use the <code>git reset unwanted_file</code> command with the file you don't want to stage. By using this command, we can move the changed file from the staging area to the working directory.</p>

     <h3>In case if you want to revert to a last commit and remove the log history as well</h3>
     <p>Use the below command. Let’s say you want to go to a previous commit which has commit ID SHA-1 hash value:</p>
     <p><strong>71e2e57458bde883a37b332035f784c6653ec509</strong></p>
     <p>Then you can point to this commit. It will not display any log message after this commit and all history will be erased after that.</p>
     <p><strong>git push origin +71e2e57458bde883a37b332035f784c6653ec509^:master</strong></p>

     <p>the best way for this siatuation use <strong>git reset</strong>, depend on your purpose of you to choose one of these option below. To remember action, I recommend the order:</p>
     <ol>
      <li><strong>git reset --soft HEAD^</strong>:<br><strong>uncommit</strong> changes, changes are left in staging/index/cached</li>
      <li><strong>git reset --mixed HEAD^</strong>: (default):<br><strong>uncommit</strong> changes + unstage, changes are left in working tree</li>
      <li><strong>git reset --hard HEAD^</strong>:<br><strong>uncommit</strong> changes + <strong>unstage</strong> + <strong>remove changes</strong>, nothing left.</li>
     </ol>
