    <p><strong>Edit</strong>: It turns out the problem is not about Jackson, but about time adjustment in Thailand on 1 April 1920.</p>
    <p>How does com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper works? I thought it used Unix timestamp.</p>
    <p>I tried converting a java.util.Date with mapper.writeValueAsString().</p>
    <p>When I convert the string back to Date with mapper.readerFor(Date.class).readValue(), the result is correct.</p>
    <p>However, when I trying removing the last 3 digits and and put the same string into some converter websites, the result is off for some minutes and seconds.</p>
    <p>Please see the code below.</p>
    <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>Date wayBack = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd").parse("1900-01-31");
System.out.println(wayBack); // Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 ICT 1900
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
System.out.println(mapper.writeValueAsString(wayBack)); // -2206420924000
Date deserialised = mapper.readerFor(Date.class).readValue(mapper.writeValueAsString(wayBack));
System.out.println(deserialised); // Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 ICT 1900

    <p>Please note that 7-hour off is expected because of my timezone but I don't understand the 17:56 minutes different.</p>

I can't explain your retroactive point - I don't see where any retroactive application of the 1920 change is taking place. But my original question was wrong to emphasize that 1920 point in the way it did - I think it's not a direct answer to the question - it's a background point, at best, perhaps.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">andrewJames</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">22 May 2020 at 19:53</span></td>

     <p><strong>EDIT</strong> - <em>Here is my attempt to provide a better answer than my first one.</em></p>
     <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
     <p>Before looking at the code in the question, some background notes:</p>
     <p>The epoch value (in seconds) at midnight 31st Jan 1900 in Bangkok is -2206420924:</p>
     <pre><code>LocalDateTime localDateTime = LocalDateTime.parse("1900-01-31T00:00:00");
ZoneId z = ZoneId.of("Asia/Bangkok");
ZonedDateTime ict_1 = ZonedDateTime.of(localDateTime, z);
System.out.println("Epoch seconds: " + ict_1.toEpochSecond());
System.out.println("ICT datetime : " + ict_1);
</code></pre>
     <p>The above prints this:</p>
     <pre><code>Epoch seconds: -2206420924
ICT datetime : 1900-01-31T00:00+06:42:04[Asia/Bangkok]
</code></pre>
     <p>The epoch value (in seconds) for UTC midnight on the same date is -1570060800:</p>
     <pre><code>ZonedDateTime utcDateTime = ZonedDateTime.parse("1900-01-31T00:00:00Z");
System.out.println("Epoch seconds: " + utcDateTime.toEpochSecond());
System.out.println("UTC datetime : " + utcDateTime);
</code></pre>
     <p>The above prints this:</p>
     <pre><code>Epoch seconds: -2206396800
UTC datetime : 1900-01-31T00:00Z
</code></pre>
     <p>The time at midnight in Bangkok on 31st January 1900 was 24,124 seconds further into the past than the time at midnight in Greenwich, UK (the prime meridian - or UTC).</p>
     <p>That is to say, on that date Bangkok was 6 hours, 42 minutes and 4 seconds ahead of UTC time (or GMT as I believe it was then called - as UTC had not been established at that time).</p>
     <p><strong>The Specific Code in the Question</strong></p>
     <p>First, I changed my default time zone to match the one used in the question:</p>
     <pre><code>System.setProperty("user.timezone", "Asia/Bangkok");
</code></pre>
     <p>The below line from the question does the following:</p>
     <p>(1) The <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> constructor, in which the date format string does not specify a locale, uses the default locale.</p>
     <p>(2) Then the <code>parse()</code> method creates the Date object:</p>
     <pre><code>Date wayBack = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd").parse("1900-01-31");
</code></pre>
     <p>At this point we can check the date object:</p>
     <pre><code>System.out.println(wayBack);
System.out.println(wayBack.getTime());
</code></pre>
     <p>This prints the following:</p>
     <pre><code>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 ICT 1900
-2206420924000 // epoch milliseconds
</code></pre>
     <p>This matches what we saw earlier, in the background section.</p>
     <p>When you use an online tool such as the one mentioned in the question, you will see the above milliseconds value reported as the following GMT (UTC) datetime:</p>
     <pre><code>GMT: Tuesday, January 30, 1900 5:17:56 PM
</code></pre>
     <p>For the above output I used <a href="https://www.epochconverter.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this tool</a>.</p>
     <p>Again, this is what we expect - when it's midnight in Bangkok, it's still the afternoon of the day before in Greenwich, UK.</p>
     <p>The remainder of the code (including the Jackson object mapper transformations) are all subject to this initial set-up of your <code>Date</code> object.</p>
     <p>For the question: "<em>How does com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper works? I thought it used Unix timestamp.</em>" It shows the same behavior as the core Java date object. I believe your assumption is correct.</p>
     <p><strong>Regarding the Unusual Offset</strong></p>
     <p>Regarding the ICT offset of <code>+06:42:04</code> shown above:</p>
     <p>On April 1st 1920, an adjustment was made to the local ICT (Indochina Time), to align it with UTC time (with an offset of +7 hours, as you note). The local clocks were <em>set forward</em> by 17 minutes and 56 seconds, to round up the UTC (GMT) offset to 7 hours.</p>
     <p>See <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/thailand?year=1920" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this link</a> for a specific reference to the 17 minutes &amp; 56 seconds change.</p>
     <p>This is why you will not see that unusual offset from April 1920 onwards.</p>
