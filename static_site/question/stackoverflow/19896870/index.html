    <p><em>Note: This is intended to be a canonical answer for a common problem.</em></p>
    <p>I have a Spring <code>@Service</code> class (<code>MileageFeeCalculator</code>) that has an <code>@Autowired</code> field (<code>rateService</code>), but the field is <code>null</code> when I try to use it. The logs show that both the <code>MileageFeeCalculator</code> bean and the <code>MileageRateService</code> bean are being created, but I get a <code>NullPointerException</code> whenever I try to call the <code>mileageCharge</code> method on my service bean. Why isn't Spring autowiring the field?</p>
    <p>Controller class:</p>
    <pre><code>@Controller
public class MileageFeeController {    
    @RequestMapping("/mileage/{miles}")
    @ResponseBody
    public float mileageFee(@PathVariable int miles) {
        MileageFeeCalculator calc = new MileageFeeCalculator();
        return calc.mileageCharge(miles);
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Service class:</p>
    <pre><code>@Service
public class MileageFeeCalculator {

    @Autowired
    private MileageRateService rateService; // &lt;--- should be autowired, is null

    public float mileageCharge(final int miles) {
        return (miles * rateService.ratePerMile()); // &lt;--- throws NPE
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Service bean that should be autowired in <code>MileageFeeCalculator</code> but it isn't:</p>
    <pre><code>@Service
public class MileageRateService {
    public float ratePerMile() {
        return 0.565f;
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>When I try to <code>GET /mileage/3</code>, I get this exception:</p>
    <pre><code>java.lang.NullPointerException: null

     <p>The field annotated <code>@Autowired</code> is <code>null</code> because Spring doesn't know about the copy of <code>MileageFeeCalculator</code> that you created with <code>new</code> and didn't know to autowire it.</p>
     <p><a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html">The Spring Inversion of Control (IoC) container</a> has three main logical components: a registry (called the <code>ApplicationContext</code>) of components (beans) that are available to be used by the application, a configurer system that injects objects' dependencies into them by matching up the dependencies with beans in the context, and a dependency solver that can look at a configuration of many different beans and determine how to instantiate and configure them in the necessary order.</p>
     <p>The IoC container isn't magic, and it has no way of knowing about Java objects unless you somehow inform it of them. When you call <code>new</code>, the JVM instantiates a copy of the new object and hands it straight to you--it never goes through the configuration process. There are three ways that you can get your beans configured.</p>
     <p>I have posted all of this code, using Spring Boot to launch, at <a href="https://github.com/chrylis/spring_autowired_npe_example">this GitHub project</a>; you can look at a full running project for each approach to see everything you need to make it work. <strong>Tag with the <code>NullPointerException</code>: <a href="https://github.com/chrylis/spring_autowired_npe_example/tree/nonworking"><code>nonworking</code></a></strong></p>
     <h2>Inject your beans</h2>
     <p>The most preferable option is to let Spring autowire all of your beans; this requires the least amount of code and is the most maintainable. To make the autowiring work like you wanted, also autowire the <code>MileageFeeCalculator</code> like this:</p>
     <pre><code>@Controller
public class MileageFeeController {

    @Autowired
    private MileageFeeCalculator calc;

    @RequestMapping("/mileage/{miles}")
    @ResponseBody
    public float mileageFee(@PathVariable int miles) {
        return calc.mileageCharge(miles);
    }
}
</code></pre>
     <p>If you need to create a new instance of your service object for different requests, you can still use injection by using <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-factory-scopes">the Spring bean scopes</a>.</p>
     <p><strong>Tag that works by injecting the <code>@MileageFeeCalculator</code> service object: <a href="https://github.com/chrylis/spring_autowired_npe_example/tree/working-inject-bean"><code>working-inject-bean</code></a></strong></p>
     <h2>Use @Configurable</h2>
     <p>If you really need objects created with <code>new</code> to be autowired, you can <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/aop.html#aop-atconfigurable">use the Spring <code>@Configurable</code> annotation along with AspectJ compile-time weaving</a> to inject your objects. This approach inserts code into your object's constructor that alerts Spring that it's being created so that Spring can configure the new instance. This requires a bit of configuration in your build (such as compiling with <code>ajc</code>) and turning on Spring's runtime configuration handlers (<code>@EnableSpringConfigured</code> with the JavaConfig syntax). This approach is used by the Roo Active Record system to allow <code>new</code> instances of your entities to get the necessary persistence information injected.</p>
     <pre><code>@Service
@Configurable
public class MileageFeeCalculator {

    @Autowired
    private MileageRateService rateService;

    public float mileageCharge(final int miles) {
        return (miles * rateService.ratePerMile());
    }
}
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>Tag that works by using <code>@Configurable</code> on the service object: <a href="https://github.com/chrylis/spring_autowired_npe_example/tree/working-configurable"><code>working-configurable</code></a></strong></p>
     <h2>Manual bean lookup: not recommended</h2>
     <p>This approach is suitable only for interfacing with legacy code in special situations. It is nearly always preferable to create a singleton adapter class that Spring can autowire and the legacy code can call, but it is possible to directly ask the Spring application context for a bean.</p>
     <p>To do this, you need a class to which Spring can give a reference to the <code>ApplicationContext</code> object:</p>
     <pre><code>@Component
public class ApplicationContextHolder implements ApplicationContextAware {
    private static ApplicationContext context;

    @Override
    public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException {
        context = applicationContext;   
    }

    public static ApplicationContext getContext() {
        return context;
    }
}
</code></pre>
     <p>Then your legacy code can call <code>getContext()</code> and retrieve the beans it needs:</p>
     <pre><code>@Controller
public class MileageFeeController {    
    @RequestMapping("/mileage/{miles}")
    @ResponseBody
    public float mileageFee(@PathVariable int miles) {
        MileageFeeCalculator calc = ApplicationContextHolder.getContext().getBean(MileageFeeCalculator.class);
        return calc.mileageCharge(miles);
    }
}
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>Tag that works by manually looking up the service object in the Spring context: <a href="https://github.com/chrylis/spring_autowired_npe_example/tree/working-manual-lookup"><code>working-manual-lookup</code></a></strong></p>

     <p>If you are not coding a web application, make sure your class in which @Autowiring is done is a spring bean. Typically, spring container won't be aware of the class which we might think of as a spring bean. We have to tell the Spring container about our spring classes.</p>

     <p>Actually, you should use either JVM managed Objects or Spring-managed Object to invoke methods. from your above code in your controller class, you are creating a new object to call your service class which has an auto-wired object.</p>
     <pre><code>MileageFeeCalculator calc = new MileageFeeCalculator();
</code></pre>
     <p>so it won't work that way.</p>
     <p>The solution makes this MileageFeeCalculator as an auto-wired object in the Controller itself.</p>
     <p>Change your Controller class like below.</p>
     <pre><code>@Controller
public class MileageFeeController {

    @Autowired
    MileageFeeCalculator calc;

     <p>I once encountered the same issue when I was <em>not quite used to the life in the IoC world</em>. The <code>@Autowired</code> field of one of my beans is null at runtime.</p>
     <p>The root cause is, instead of using the auto-created bean maintained by the Spring IoC container (whose <code>@Autowired</code> field is indeed properly injected), I am <code>new</code>ing my own instance of that bean type and using it. Of course this one's <code>@Autowired</code> field is null because Spring has no chance to inject it.</p>

     <p>Your problem is new (object creation in java style)</p>
     <pre><code>MileageFeeCalculator calc = new MileageFeeCalculator();
</code></pre>
     <p>With annotation <code>@Service</code>, <code>@Component</code>, <code>@Configuration</code> beans are created in the<br>
       application context of Spring when server is started. But when we create objects using new operator the object is not registered in application context which is already created. For Example Employee.java class i have used.</p>
     <p>Check this out:</p>
     <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public class ConfiguredTenantScopedBeanProcessor implements BeanFactoryPostProcessor {
    @Override
    public void postProcessBeanFactory(ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory) throws BeansException {
        String name = "tenant";
        System.out.println("Bean factory post processor is initialized"); 
        beanFactory.registerScope("employee", new Employee());

        Assert.state(beanFactory instanceof BeanDefinitionRegistry,
                "BeanFactory was not a BeanDefinitionRegistry, so CustomScope cannot be used.");
        BeanDefinitionRegistry registry = (BeanDefinitionRegistry) beanFactory;

        for (String beanName : beanFactory.getBeanDefinitionNames()) {
            BeanDefinition definition = beanFactory.getBeanDefinition(beanName);
            if (name.equals(definition.getScope())) {
                BeanDefinitionHolder proxyHolder = ScopedProxyUtils.createScopedProxy(new BeanDefinitionHolder(definition, beanName), registry, true);
                registry.registerBeanDefinition(beanName, proxyHolder.getBeanDefinition());
            }
        }
    }
}

     <p><em>I'm new to Spring, but I discovered this working solution. Please tell me if it's a deprecable way.</em></p>
     <p>I make Spring inject <code>applicationContext</code> in this bean:</p>
     <pre><code>import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class SpringUtils {

    public static ApplicationContext ctx;

    /**
     * Make Spring inject the application context
     * and save it on a static variable,
     * so that it can be accessed from any point in the application. 
     */
    @Autowired
    private void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) {
        ctx = applicationContext;       
    }
}
</code></pre>
     <p>You can put this code also in the main application class if you want.</p>
     <p>Other classes can use it like this:</p>
     <pre><code>MyBean myBean = (MyBean)SpringUtils.ctx.getBean(MyBean.class);
</code></pre>
     <p>In this way <strong>any bean can be obtained by any object in the application</strong> (also intantiated with <code>new</code>) and <strong>in a static way</strong>.</p>

     <p>It seems to be rare case but here is what happened to me:</p>
     <p>We used <code>@Inject</code> instead of <code>@Autowired</code> which is javaee standard supported by Spring. Every places it worked fine and the beans injected correctly, instead of one place. The bean injection seems the same</p>
     <pre><code>@Inject
Calculator myCalculator
</code></pre>
     <p>At last we found that the error was that we (actually, the Eclipse auto complete feature) imported <code>com.opensymphony.xwork2.Inject</code> instead of <code>javax.inject.Inject</code> !</p>
     <p>So to summarize, make sure that your annotations (<code>@Autowired</code>, <code>@Inject</code>, <code>@Service</code> ,... ) have correct packages!</p>

     <p>After "learning" that I had to annotate a class with @Component or the derivatives @Service or @Repository (I guess there are more), to autowire other components inside them, it struck me that these other components still were null inside the constructor of the parent component.</p>
     <p>Using @PostConstruct solves that:</p>
     <pre><code>@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

     <p><strong>One of the below will work :</strong></p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>The class where you are using @Autowired is not a Bean (You may have used new() somewhere I am sure).</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Inside the SpringConfig class you have not mentioned the packages the Spring should look for @Component ( I am talking about @ComponentScan(basePackages"here") )</p></li>

     <p>If this is happening in a test class, make sure you haven't forgotten to annotate the class.</p>
     <p>For example, in <strong>Spring Boot</strong>:</p>
     <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
public class MyTests {
    ....
</code></pre>
     <hr>
     <h2>Some time elapses...</h2>
     <p>Spring Boot <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2016/04/15/testing-improvements-in-spring-boot-1-4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">continues to evolve</a>. It is no longer required to use <code>@RunWith</code> <em>if you use the correct version of JUnit</em>.</p>
     <p>For <code>@SpringBootTest</code> to work stand alone, you need to use <code>@Test</code> from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/48853312">JUnit5 instead of JUnit4</a>.</p>
     <pre><code>//import org.junit.Test; // JUnit4
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; // JUnit5

@SpringBootTest
public class MyTests {
    ....
</code></pre>
     <hr>
     <p>If you get this configuration wrong your tests will compile, but <code>@Autowired</code> and <code>@Value</code> fields (for example) will be <code>null</code>. Since Spring Boot operates by magic, you may have few avenues for directly debugging this failure.</p>

     <p>In simple words there are mainly two reasons for an <code>@Autowired</code> field to be <code>null</code></p>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>YOUR CLASS IS NOT A SPRING BEAN.</strong></li>
     </ul>
     <p>The class in which you define the <code>@Autowire</code> anotation is not a spring bean. Thus spring will not auto wire the members.</p>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>THE FIELD IS NOT A BEAN.</strong></li>
     </ul>
     <p>There is no bean with the type or type in hierarchy you specified in the <code>@Autowired</code> field is not yet present in the spring application context or registry</p>

     <p>I think you have missed to instruct spring to scan classes with annotation.</p>
     <p>You can use <code>@ComponentScan("packageToScan")</code> on the configuration class of your spring application to instruct spring to scan.</p>
     <p><code>@Service, @Component</code> etc annotations add meta description. <br></p>
     <p>Spring only injects instances of those classes which are either created as bean or marked with annotation.</p>
     <p>Classes marked with annotation need to be identified by spring before injecting, <code>@ComponentScan</code> instruct spring look for the classes marked with annotation. When Spring finds <code>@Autowired</code> it searches for the related bean, and injects the required instance.</p>
     <p>Adding annotation only, does not fix or facilitate the dependency injection, Spring needs to know where to look for.</p>

     <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Really smart people were quick to point on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/13177782/2583044">this</a> answer, which explains the weirdness, described below</p>
     <p><strong>ORIGINAL ANSWER:</strong></p>
     <p>I don't know if it helps anyone, but I was stuck with the same problem even while doing things seemingly right. In my Main method, I have a code like this:</p>
     <pre><code>ApplicationContext context =
    new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(new String[] {
        "common.xml",
        "token.xml",
        "pep-config.xml" });
    TokenInitializer ti = context.getBean(TokenInitializer.class);
</code></pre>
     <p>and in a <code>token.xml</code> file I've had a line</p>
     <pre><code>&lt;context:component-scan base-package="package.path"/&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>I noticed that the package.path does no longer exist, so I've just dropped the line for good.</p>
     <p>And after that, NPE started coming in. In a <code>pep-config.xml</code> I had just 2 beans:</p>
     <pre><code>&lt;bean id="someAbac" class="com.pep.SomeAbac" init-method="init"/&gt;
&lt;bean id="settings" class="com.pep.Settings"/&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>and SomeAbac class has a property declared as</p>
     <pre><code>@Autowired private Settings settings;

     <p>for some unknown reason, settings is <em>null</em> in init(), when <code>&lt;context:component-scan/&gt;</code> element is not present at all, but when it's present and has some bs as a basePackage, everything works well. This line now looks like this:</p>
     <pre><code>&lt;context:component-scan base-package="some.shit"/&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>and it works. May be someone can provide an explanation, but for me it's enough right now )</p>

     <p>Also note that if, for whatever reason, you make a method in a <code>@Service</code> as <code>final</code>, the autowired beans you will access from it will always be <code>null</code>.</p>

     <p>You can also fix this issue using @Service annotation on service class and passing the required bean classA as a parameter to the other beans classB constructor and annotate the constructor of classB with @Autowired. Sample snippet here :</p>
     <pre><code>@Service
public class ClassB {

    private ClassA classA;

    @Autowired
    public ClassB(ClassA classA) {
        this.classA = classA;
    }

    public void useClassAObjectHere(){
        classA.callMethodOnObjectA();
    }
}

        <td><span>@CruelEngine, look this is constructor injection (where you explicitly setting an object) instead of just using field injection (this is mostly done by spring configuration mostly). So if you are creating a object of ClassB using "new" operator is some other scope then that would not be visible or autowired set for ClassA. Hence, while calling classB.useClassAObjectHere() would throw NPE as classA object was not autowired if you just declare field Injection. Read chrylis is trying to explain same. And this why constructor injection is recommended over field injection. Does it make sense now ?</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Abhishek</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">11 Apr 2018 at 08:45</span></td>

     <p>This is only valid in case of Unit test.</p>
     <p>My Service class had an annotation of service and it was <code>@autowired</code> another component class. When I tested the component class was coming null. Because for service class I was creating the object using <code>new</code></p>
     <p>If you are writing unit test make sure you are not creating object using <code>new object()</code>. Use instead injectMock.</p>
     <p>This fixed my issue. Here is a useful <a href="https://www.moreofless.co.uk/spring-mvc-java-autowired-component-null-repository-service/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a></p>

     <p>Not entirely related to the question, but if the field injection is null, the constructor based injection will still work fine.</p>
     <pre><code>    private OrderingClient orderingClient;
    private Sales2Client sales2Client;
    private Settings2Client settings2Client;

    @Autowired
    public BrinkWebTool(OrderingClient orderingClient, Sales2Client sales2Client, Settings2Client settings2Client) {
        this.orderingClient = orderingClient;
        this.sales2Client = sales2Client;

     <p>if you are using a <code>private</code> method, it will be <code>null</code>, try to change <code>private</code> to <code>public</code> in controller.</p>
