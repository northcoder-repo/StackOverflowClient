    <pre><code>public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
     long ageEarth = 4543000000L; 
     System.out.println(ageEarth);

     double ageEarth1 = ageEarth;
     System.out.println(ageEarth1);

     ageEarth1 = (long) ageEarth1;
     System.out.println(ageEarth1) 


}
</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Playing</strong> around with the value <strong>4543000000</strong> and passing it to <strong>double</strong> and again to <strong>long</strong> gives me,</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>scientific notation: 4.543E9</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>but scientific notation is a point float number, and long only accepts integers, what's going on here?</p>
    <p>/////// EDIT:</p>
    <p>I apply the code you guys tell me and give us what we expect but:</p>
    <pre><code>    long ageEarth = 4543000000L; 
    System.out.println(ageEarth);

    double ageEarth1 = ageEarth;
    System.out.println(ageEarth1);

    ageEarth1 = (long) ageEarth1;
    System.out.println(ageEarth1)

    long ageEarth2 = (long) ageEarth1; 
    System.out.println(ageEarth2);
</code></pre>
    <p>I do not understand the 3rd one printed is by <code>System.out.println(ageEarth1);</code> this is when is converted to <code>ageEarth1 = (long) ageEarth1;</code> it should give a result of an integer right? So why gives still scientific notation?</p>

    <p>What do you mean truncate the data? Correct me, do you refer to corrupt the data?</p>
    <p>4.543E9 = 4543000000</p>

     <p><code>ageEarth1</code> is of type <code>double</code>, not <code>long</code>.</p>
     <p>Converting it to a <code>long</code> by casting it will truncate it, but then you store it as a <code>double</code>, so it will behave like one when used, because it is a <code>double</code>.</p>
     <p>If you convert it back and store the data as a <code>long</code>, you'll see that it prints as you expect:</p>
     <pre><code>long ageEarth2 = (long)ageEarth1;
System.out.println(ageEarth2);

     <p>After editing the question, the OP asked:</p>
     <p><em>the 3rd one printed is by System.out.println(ageEarth1); this is when is converted to ageEarth1 = (long) ageEarth1; it should give a result of an integer right? So why gives still scientific notation?</em></p>
     <p><img src="kC3RY.png" alt="number listing"></p>
     <p>I will try to recap Carcigenicate's answer and elaborate on it. Hope this helps!</p>
     <p>I will separate this into 2 parts:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>assignment statements</li>
      <li>print statements (number formatting)</li>
     </ul>
     <p><strong>The Assignment Statements</strong></p>
     <p>Here are the statements (where "A" is for assignment, and "P" is for print):</p>
     <pre><code>long ageEarth = 4543000000L;        // A1
System.out.println(ageEarth);       // P1

double ageEarth1 = ageEarth;        // A2
System.out.println(ageEarth1);      // P2

ageEarth1 = (long) ageEarth1;       // A3
System.out.println(ageEarth1)       // P3

long ageEarth2 = (long) ageEarth1;  // A4
System.out.println(ageEarth2);      // P4
</code></pre>
     <p>Looking at statement A3, the point to note is that it does not create a new variable - it re-uses the variable from A2: <code>double ageEarth1</code>. The end result of A3 is that the variable <code>ageEarth1</code> is still a <code>double</code>.</p>
     <p><em><strong>We did not change the variable's data type</strong></em>.</p>
     <p>In fact, the Java compiler <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27092245/can-i-change-declaration-type-for-a-variable-in-java">would not let you change it</a> even if you tried.</p>
     <p>So, what does that <code>(long) ageEarth1</code> do in statement A3? It takes the value stored in <code>ageEarth1</code> (from statement A2) and converts it from a <code>double</code> storage structure to a <code>long</code> storage structure<sup>*</sup>.</p>
     <p>But then, as we have already seen, that result is assigned back to the <code>ageEarth1</code> variable - which is still a <code>double</code>. So the storage is converted back again from <code>long</code> to <code>double</code><sup>*</sup>.</p>
     <p><strong>The Print Statements</strong></p>
     <p>Why do these example <code>float</code> values use scientific notation when they are displayed by the print statements? This is summarized by the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Float.html#toString(float)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> - see the bullet point which starts:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>If m is less than 10<sup>-3</sup> or greater than or equal to 10<sup>7</sup>, then it is represented in so-called "computerized scientific notation."</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>By contrast the rules for printing a <code>long</code> are summarized <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Long.html#toString(long)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
     <p><sup>* <em>Conceptually, at least. Under the covers, the Java implementation may well be smarter than I am suggesting.</em></sup></p>

     <p>Thanks for your help you all, now I understand:</p>
     <p>We can not refactor or change the data type of a variable in a new another statement on the same scope, that's why give me scientific notation, yes casting is working <code>(long) ageEarth1</code> = <code>4543000000</code>, but because of the variable <code>ageEarth1</code> is type double, it can only support floating-point number, so to satisfy this inherited instance, the variable condition will make the compiler to change it again from the result of casting to long <code>4543000000</code> <strong>TO</strong> <code>4.543E9</code>.</p>
     <p>That's why you tell me I need to create a new variable long, so it can contain the integer <code>4543000000</code>, hence the compiler will not change the result of casting to long <code>4543000000</code> <strong>TO</strong> <code>4.543E9</code> because it satisfies the condition of containing whole numbers.</p>
