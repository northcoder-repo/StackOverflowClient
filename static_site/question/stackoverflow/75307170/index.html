   </div>
   <div>
    <p>Context:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>We are using Azure Cognitive Services in a mobile app to search patient diagnostic codes (ICD10 codes).</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>The ICD10 code list is approximately 94,000 items. For anyone interested here is a <a href="https://github.com/Bobrovskiy/ICD-10-CSV/tree/master/2020" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list</a>.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>We currently have set-up a standard Lucene analyser on the diagnostic description field</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Requirement:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>We want to provide a really good <strong>search as you type</strong> experience, which provides the most relevant suggestions</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Using the <code>Suggest</code> method with the <code>fuzzy</code> parameter set to <code>true</code> works reasonably well for a <strong>single</strong> search term:</p>
      <ul>
       <li><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/udpws.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/75307170/udpws.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></li>
      </ul></li>
     <li>
      <p>As you can see it does well in finding <em>partial</em> matches <strong>and</strong> is resilient to <em>typos</em>.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>The issue comes in when I add a second search term. E.g. I want to search for <code>asthma</code> that is <code>moderate</code>:</p>
      <ul>
       <li><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/141fh.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/75307170/141fh.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></li>
       <li><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gIeem.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/75307170/gIeem.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></li>
      </ul></li>
     <li>
      <p>In both these examples, there is no match.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>So when searching for more than one term, requiring the user to express this in the sequence that this is in the data is not a good user experience.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Using the <code>Search</code> method instead, we can overcome the problem of finding matches where 2 search terms are supplied that do not appear consecutively in the data:</p>
      <ul>
       <li><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6aHbr.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/75307170/6aHbr.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></li>
      </ul></li>
     <li>
      <p>And this is resilient to typos</p></li>
     <li>
      <p><strong>However</strong>, this is not good at finding partial matches (like the <code>Suggest</code> does).</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>E.g. in this search, we would still want the term <code>moderate</code> to be picked up: <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fQbJx.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/75307170/fQbJx.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Seemingly if we could combine a wild card search with a fuzzy search we could solve this problem. e.g. supplying the following search phrase: <code>ashtma~* AND moder~*</code>.</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>But from what we have seen this syntax is not supported.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any suggestions on how to overcome this limitation so we can get the best of both worlds, i.e:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>For 2 or more search terms, it will work on <em>partial</em> matches</li>
     <li>And the search terms are treated independently and do not need to appear consecutively in the data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many thanks in advance, Andreas.</p>

     <p>I recommend using (or at least experimenting with) Lucene ngrams.</p>
     <p>An example custom analyzer can use the <a href="https://lucenenet.apache.org/docs/4.8.0-beta00016/api/analysis-common/Lucene.Net.Analysis.NGram.NGramTokenFilter.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>NGramTokenFilter</code></a>.</p>
     <p>This filter splits each source token into one or more indexed tokens by chopping up the source into substrings of different lengths.</p>
     <p>An example from the above link:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>"abc" will give "a", "ab", "abc", "b", "bc", "c"</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>You can, as an example, set each token to be from 3 to 5 characters long (but this is one of the areas where you can experiment with different settings).</p>
     <p>When you use this analyzer for indexing, it's going to create many more tokens (larger index) but that gives you more searching flexibility.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>Use the same analyzer for searching.</p>
     <p>If the user enters the following two words as their search values:</p>
     <pre><code>ashtma moder
</code></pre>
     <p>You would convert that into the following Lucene search phrase:</p>
     <pre><code>ashtma~ AND moder~
</code></pre>
     <p>This will find the following hits:</p>
     <pre><code>  doc id = 12877
  field  = Moderate persistent asthma with status asthmaticus

  doc id = 12874
  field  = Moderate persistent asthma

  doc id = 12875
  field  = Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated

  doc id = 12876
  field  = Moderate persistent asthma with (acute) exacerbation

  doc id = 94210
  field  = Family history of asthma and oth chronic lower resp diseases

  doc id = 6970
  field  = Xanthelasma of right lower eyelid

  doc id = 6973
  field  = Xanthelasma of left lower eyelid

  doc id = 6979
  field  = Chloasma of right lower eyelid and periocular area

  doc id = 6982
  field  = Chloasma of left lower eyelid and periocular area
</code></pre>
     <p>As you can see it does find some false positives, but the first four hits (the highest scored) are the ones you want.</p>
     <p>You can see how this approach performs in terms of index size and search speed.</p>
     <p>One reason for suggesting ngrams is your point about wanting to handle mis-spellings: ngrams may help to isolate spelling mistakes into smaller tokens,since the <code>~</code> fuzzy search operator is fairly limited in what it can handle. But, definitely experiment with different ngram lengths - and maybe also without using ngrams at all.</p>

You may get a more focused/useful answer if you ask a brand new and more specific Azure Cognitive Search question, showing the relevant code - and maybe your attempt to use ngrams in that code. Someone may also show you a better way.
