   <div>
    <p>I have the following code:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schrödinger
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p></p>
    <p>When I run it in my browser I get:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Schr�dinger</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>When I change the encoding to latin ISO:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="ISO-8859-1"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schrödinger
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p></p>
    <p>It works good:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>Schrödinger</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Curiously, using the code snippet tool on this site, utf-8 works good:</p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">
     <div class="snippet-code">
      <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;

	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Schrödinger
	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
     </div>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p>Using UTF8 should work even better than Latin ISO (it supports more characters).</p>
    <p>What can the problem be?</p>
    <p>I tested both in Chrome and Firefox. I am using Windows 7 in an old PC.</p>

     <p>You are right that UTF-8 can represent more characters than ISO-8859-1, but it also represents the <em>same</em> characters <em>differently</em>.</p>
     <p>To understand what that means, you need to think about the <em>binary</em> representation that a computer uses for text. When you save some text to a file, what you are actually doing is writing some sequence of ones and zeroes to disk; when you load that file in a web browser, it has to look at that sequence of ones and zeroes and decide what to display.</p>
     <p>A character encoding is the way that the browser decides what to display for each sequence of ones and zeroes.</p>
     <p>In ISO-8859-1, the character "ö" is written as the sequence 111101110. In UTF-8, that same character would instead be written 1100001110110110, and 111101110 would mean something else (in fact, because of the way UTF-8 works, it represents half of something, so can't be displayed).</p>
     <p>Your file contains 111101110, so the correct thing to tell the browser is "read this as ISO 8859-1 please". Alternatively, you can open the file in an editor that "knows" both encodings, and tell that editor to rewrite it as UTF-8, so the character will be saved as 1100001110110110 instead.</p>
     <p>This is what happens when you paste the character here: your browser knows that Stack Overflow wants the UTF-8 version, and converts it to 1100001110110110 for you.</p>

     <p>The encoding is basically how the data are written in binary. The same character (e.g. <code>ö</code> ) has different binary representation depending on the charset : if your file is written latin-1 and you declare your charset as latin-1, the browser will decode it fine. If your file is written in UTF-8 and you declare your charset as utf-8, the browser will decode it fine. But if you "lie" to the browser by telling him your file is in utf-8 while it is encoded in latin-1, it will be unable to decode some characters correctly.</p>
     <p>Basic ASCII characters have usually the same binary representation whatever the encoding, so it is generally fine, but with accentued characters, it matters to declare the correct encoding.</p>
     <p>You must take into account how you wrote the file to declare the appropriate charset, it is not a wish on what character set you want.</p>

     <p>Here is a slightly different approach from the other answers, using a hands-on demonstration to recreate the issue, and then fix it.</p>
     <p>(my example uses Notepad++).</p>
     <p>1) Create a new text file, and before adding any data or saving it, change the encoding to ANSI (menu: Encoding &gt; ANSI). This assumes UTF-8 is the default.</p>
     <p>2) Enter the following text and save as "cat.htm".</p>
     <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Schrödinger&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>3) Open the file with Firefox, Chrome, etc.</p>
     <p>You will see <code>Schr�dinger</code>.</p>
     <p>If you take the above example and change the file's encoding back to UTF-8 in Notepad++ (and reinstate the <code>ö</code>) then you get the expected output: <code>Schrödinger</code>. So, yes, it's all about how the source file was saved - the binary representation.</p>
