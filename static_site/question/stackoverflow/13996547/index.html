    <p>I am new to programming in Java but am generally familiar with how everything works. I would like to be able to put both a jar file and a jre into a windows executable(exe) so that when I distribute it, the client needn't have a JRE installed. What program should I use?</p>
    <p>I have launch4j and it seems to do exactly what I want but when I try to run the app, I get "This application was configured to use a bundled Java Runtime Environment but the runtime is missing or corrupted."</p>
    <p>I want my app to just be a runnable exe, not an installer. At the very least, can anyone show me how to correctly bundle a JRE with launch4j?</p>

     <p>The only way I could bundle a JRE was to use <a href="http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/" rel="noreferrer">Launch4J</a> and <a href="http://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php" rel="noreferrer">Inno Setup Compiler</a>.</p>
     <p>First, create a <code>jre6</code> folder (for example) in the same directory as your output file (.exe).</p>
     <p>Then copy the JRE from your system into your <strong>jre6</strong> folder.</p>
     <p>Then you open Launch4J and set the <strong>Bundled JRE path</strong> - just type in <code>jre6</code>. Then click the Build button (obviously, after you've entered all the other parameters - but the only value you need to enter on the <strong>JRE</strong> tab itself is the <strong>Bundled JRE path</strong> value.)</p>
     <p>I would have expected that to work, but if you then move the .exe to a new location (so it is no longer co-located with your <strong>jre6</strong> folder) you get the <em>This application was configured to use a bundled Java Runtime Environment but the runtime is missing or corrupted</em> error when you try to run the application...</p>
     <p>I've been playing around with this all day and there was no way I could get <em>Launch4J</em> to include the JRE in the .exe file. Really poor in my opinion, as their documentation does not seem to allude to this issue at all.</p>
     <p>So what I did to solve was to use <em>Inno Setup Compiler (ISC)</em>. This app is used to wrap your .exe as a Windows Installer file. So I added a setting to the ISC script that copies the JRE into the installer package. The line I added to the script (in the <code>[Files]</code> section) was:</p>
     <pre><code>Source: "M:\Netbeans\MyApp\jre6\*"; DestDir: "{app}\jre6\"; Flags: recursesubdirs createallsubdirs
</code></pre>
     <p>...a bit of workaround, but it did the trick.</p>
     <p>Repeat all the above steps, and you should be sorted.</p>

     <p><strong>Bundled JRE Solution for Inno Setup</strong></p>
     <p>In order to implement a bundled JRE solution with an application jar, I created an Inno Setup script that:</p>
     <p>1) copies the JRE into the install exe</p>
     <p>2) executes the equivalent of terminal command: java -jar myjar.jar using the bundled JRE</p>
     <p>Firstly I copy the JRE:</p>
     <pre><code>#define MyJREPath "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_191"

[Files]
Source: "{#MyJREPath}\*"; DestDir: "{app}\runtime\jre\";  \
        Flags: ignoreversion recursesubdirs createallsubdirs;  
</code></pre>
     <p>I follow the directory structure convention shown here: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/deploy/self-contained-packaging.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/deploy/self-contained-packaging.html</a></p>
     <p>To run the equivalent of java -jar myjar.jar:</p>
     <pre><code>[Run]
Filename: "{app}\runtime\jre\bin\javaw.exe"; Parameters: " -jar myjar.jar"; \
          WorkingDir: "{app}\app\"; \
          Description: "{cm:LaunchProgram,{#StringChange(MyAppName, '&amp;', '&amp;&amp;')}}"; \
          Flags: postinstall skipifsilent   
</code></pre>
     <p>(n.b. java.exe runs with a terminal and javaw.exe runs without a terminal)</p>
     <p>Desktop shortcut needs to have the right filename, parameters and working directory:</p>
     <pre><code>[Icons]
Name: "{commondesktop}\{#MyAppName}"; \
      IconFilename: "{app}\app\{#MyAppIcoName}"; \
      Filename: "{app}\runtime\jre\bin\javaw.exe"; \
      Parameters: " -jar myjar.jar"; \
      WorkingDir: "{app}\app\"; \
      Tasks: desktopicon

[Tasks]
Name: "desktopicon"; \
    Description: "{cm:CreateDesktopIcon}"; \
    GroupDescription: "{cm:AdditionalIcons}"; \
    Flags: unchecked
</code></pre>
     <p>For the icing on the cake, in order make my script handle both bundled JRE and none bundled options I use the Preprocessor IF statement (duplicated in each script section) to test whether the script has an empty MyJREPath or not. If MyJREPath is not empty and so a bundled JRE solution is required I use the coding above; alternatively if a bundled solution is not required then I use more "normal" coding shown the Inno Setup examples or generated by their wizard. Here's the IF statement:</p>
     <pre><code>#if MyJREPath != ""
    ; bundled JRE required

#else
    ; bundled JRE not required
#endif
</code></pre>
     <p>Here's most of my script put together:</p>
     <pre><code>        ; Script generated by the Inno Setup Script Wizard.
        ; SEE THE DOCUMENTATION FOR DETAILS ON CREATING INNO SETUP SCRIPT FILES!


        ; some more #defines here

        #define MyAppExeName "javaw.exe"
        #define MyJREPath "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_191" 
        ;#define MyJREPath ""

     <p>I've never used the Launch4J product, good luck in getting it configured correctly.</p>
     <p>Looks like you might be able to go to the Discussion Forum on Sourceforge for other hints <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/launch4j/forums/forum/332683" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
     <p>Other Suggestions:</p>
     <p>Most of the products I've seen from IBM (Websphere) and Oracle just extract a JRE under the installation directory and configure the startup batch command to use the installed JRE. Essentially the JRE and your jar file would be installed in one shot.</p>
     <p>The installation exe usually checks to see if it's already installed and skips that step if it finds it already there. This is useful for upgrades of just the jar file.</p>
     <p>Having the local installation also solves the issue of the customer installing their own JRE which may be incompatible or contain bugs. This way your dealing with a known JRE version.</p>
     <p>The excelsior route is OK if you don't have a graphical component to your application (It's been a while, that restriction may have changed). There are other restrictions as well, but you probably just better off just distributing a JRE with your code in a single executable installer.</p>

     <p>Its easy to bundle jre into launch4j..</p>
     <p>just copy the jre into the same output folder</p>
     <p>In the bundle jre environment text box, just give the jre folder itself</p>
     <p>In the environment variable text box (present in the same page below), give until bin</p>
     <p>Then create exe.. It works as expected without jre in machine.</p>
     <p>Thanks</p>

     <p>It seems you need native code compiler. These compilers produce native code which doesn't require JRE.</p>

     <p>What you're asking for isn't going to be easy to do (if it's doable at all.) If I were you I would look into creating an executable JAR file:</p>
     <p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8159046/java-eclipse-create-executable-jar">java eclipse create executable jar</a></p>
     <p>Another option would be to use Java Web Start. This was assuming you're using a modern browser the JNLP will automatically prompt the user to install the correct version of Java.</p>

     <p>There are several reason why launch4j wont run smoothly. some of the reason is:</p>
     <p>1) user do not run the application as Administrator</p>
     <p>2) User do not setup icon image properly. must strictly .ico</p>
