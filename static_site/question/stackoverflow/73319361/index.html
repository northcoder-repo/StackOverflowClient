     <p><strong>Short Answer</strong></p>
     <p>You cannot run proximity queries for data stored in a <code>StringField</code>. You have to use a <code>TextField</code>.</p>
     <p>You did not show us the definition for <code>KeyValuePairs</code>, so I have made some assumptions below about that.</p>
     <p>(Small point: I would also suggest that you do not need to use <code>LinkedList</code> - you probably only need <code>ArrayList</code>.)</p>
     <hr>
     <p><strong>Longer Answer for More Background</strong></p>
     <p>Your problem is related to the field types you are using.</p>
     <p>You have a document containing 2 fields:</p>
     <ul>
      <li><code>content</code> - which uses a <code>StringField</code></li>
      <li><code>title</code> - which uses a <code>TextField</code>.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>An example of data in the <code>content</code> field is <code>to be or not to be that is the question</code>.</p>
     <p>You are attempting to run a proximity query against the <code>content</code> field.</p>
     <p>Remember from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/73290954/12567365">this question</a> that <code>StringField</code> data "<em>is indexed but not tokenized: the entire String value is indexed as a single token.</em>"</p>
     <p>A single token, means the token's position is always effectively the <em>only</em> position - and therefore position data is not captured in the index (it is basically meaningless).</p>
     <p>That is why your query throws that error. That query requires the data to be split up into separate tokens - and each token's position needs to be captured in the index.</p>
     <p><strong>Therefore you need to use a <code>TextField</code> for that type of data.</strong></p>
     <p>When you use a <code>TextField</code> for <code>to be or not to be that is the question</code>, then the <code>StandardAnalyzer</code> causes the following data to be captured in the index:</p>
     <pre><code>field content
  term be
    doc 0
      freq 2
      pos 1
      pos 5
  term is
    doc 0
      freq 1
      pos 7
  term not
    doc 0
      freq 1
      pos 3
  term or
    doc 0
      freq 1
      pos 2
  term question
    doc 0
      freq 1
      pos 9
  term that
    doc 0
      freq 1
      pos 6
  term the
    doc 0
      freq 1
      pos 8
  term to
    doc 0
      freq 2
      pos 0
      pos 4
</code></pre>
     <p>You can see that the index now contains the required position data. The proximity query requires this position data to evaluate whether the words in your query are sufficiently close enough to each other, to match your query.</p>
     <p>And just for completeness, here is what you get in the index if you use <code>StringField</code> instead of <code>TextField</code>:</p>
     <pre><code>doc 0
  field 0
    name content
    type string
    value to be or not to be that is the question
</code></pre>
     <p>As you can see - only one token - and no position data.</p>

        <td><span>Your first comment: If you have a document containing <code>long short story</code> and you want to find a match using <code>"long story short"</code> then that requires <code>~2</code> because it takes 2 moves to transform your query word order into the document word order. Step 1: move <code>short</code> from pos n to pos n-1 (<code>short</code> is now in the same position as <code>story</code>); and then step 2: move <code>story</code> from pos n-1 to pos n (where <code>short</code> used to be). You have swapped the positions of <code>short</code> and <code>story</code> in two moves. I don't think you can combine wildcard searches and proximity searches - so you cannot do <code>"long story sho*"~2</code>.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">andrewJames</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">16 Aug 2022 at 13:11</span></td>

        <td><span>But i dont think I want to mix proximity search with wildcard. My document is containing "long story short" not "long short story". So I am searching for "long story sho*". So I guess if I am searching without changing positions of words I dont have to check for that with ~. So if I'm right I should just do a wildcard search and store my text in a document as a string file.
