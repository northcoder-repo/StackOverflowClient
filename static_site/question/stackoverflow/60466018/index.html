    <p>I want to name match appropriately, but as can be seen below it's not the match I wanted is there any way to get around this? I just want Mr Mark Longfield to be preferred over Mr Laurence Boode as it is more likely to be the correct match.</p>
    <pre><code>from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz, process

str = 'Mr Lonfield'
L = list('Mr Laurence Boode', 'Mr Mark Longfield')
print(process.extractOne(str, L))

Output: ('Mr Laurence Boode', 86)
</code></pre>
    <p>Is this more to do with the structure of the list and strings more than anything else. So if i removed peoples first name of course I'd be more likely to match but I'd rather have their full name.</p>

     <p>For what it's worth, the following will produce your expected match:</p>
     <pre><code>print(process.extractOne(str, L, scorer=fuzz.token_set_ratio))
</code></pre>
     <p>In this case, you will get:</p>
     <pre><code>('Mr Mark Longfield', 79)
</code></pre>
     <p>Laurence Boode's score is 43 in this scenario.</p>
     <p>I say <em>for what it's worth</em> because I was not able to find much detail on how this works, outside of looking at the source code (link below).</p>
     <p>Also, you would of course need to test how well this works on your larger population.</p>
     <p>There are other scorer options you can test with. One of those may be an even better fit. See <a href="https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy/blob/master/fuzzywuzzy/fuzz.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for details.</p>
     <p>I used <code>token_set_ratio</code> in Java's port of this library a while ago, for matching movie titles. If I recall, it worked well enough for my needs, but there were definitely cases where I got false positives - but that was due to the nature of certain movie titles. That probably does not apply to your scenario.</p>
     <p>I hope it helps.</p>
     <h2>Update</h2>
     <p>Some notes from comments in the source:</p>
     <p>A <em>token_set</em> is the set of alphanumeric tokens in a string (splitting on whitespace).</p>
     <p>Functions:</p>
     <p><em>token_set_ratio</em>: Returns a measure of the sequences' similarity between 0 and 100.</p>
     <p><em>token_sort_ratio</em>: Returns a measure of the sequences' similarity between 0 and 100, but sorting the tokens before comparing.</p>
     <p><em>partial_ratio</em>: Returns the ratio of the most similar substring as a number between 0 and 100.</p>
     <p><em>partial_token_set_ratio</em>: Return the ratio of the most similar substring as a number between 0 and 100.</p>
     <p><em>partial_token_sort_ratio</em>: Return the ratio of the most similar substring as a number between 0 and 100 but sorting the tokens before comparing.</p>
     <p>There are some additional <a href="https://github.com/xdrop/fuzzywuzzy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">usage examples</a> in the Java port documentation.</p>
