   <div>
    <p>I had a simple Spring MVC application with Thymeleaf. I had a controller mapped to <code>/foo/</code> and it would delegate to a view <code>/bar/view</code> using redirect, so its <code>POST</code> method would return <code>redirect:/bar/view</code>. This worked fine in my IDE, from a JAR file, and from a Docker container.</p>
    <p>I did some refactoring and remapped the controller to <code>/view</code>. Then I moved my view implementation from <code>templates/foo/view.html</code> to <code>templates/view.html</code>. And instead of sending back <code>redirect:/bar/view</code>, I sent back <code>/view</code>. This continued to work fine in my IDE (Eclipse EE 2023-03 on Windows) with Spring DevTools installed.</p>
    <p>However it would fail running from the JAR, saying that it could not find <code>/view</code>. I double-checked everything, and finally just discovered that it will now only work from a JAR file if I return <code>view</code> for the view, and not <code>/view</code>.</p>
    <p>Can someone tell me why this inconsistency exists, and point me to some documentation that covers this? Why can't I return <code>/view</code> as a view ID? But why does returning <code>/view</code> work in my IDE, but not using <code>java -jar …</code>? And finally, why does <code>redirect:/bar/view</code> work with an absolute view path, but not <code>/view</code>? I'm not arguing which way is better; I'm just wondering why the behavior is inconsistent, and wanting to know where this is documented.</p>

     <p>It's good to start with how Spring Boot resolves the view names.</p>
     <p>When you return a view with a leading slash <code>/view</code> then Spring treats it as an <strong>absolute path</strong> and looks for the view in the <strong>root directory of your app</strong>.</p>
     <p>If you are using view without a leading slash <code>view</code> then Spring treats it as a <strong>relative path</strong> and looks for the view <strong>from the current directory</strong>.</p>
     <p><strong>Why then IDE works?</strong></p>
     <p>Because IDE sets the working directory to the root of your project.</p>
     <p><strong>Why then JAR doesn't work?</strong></p>
     <p>It's because JAR sets the working directory to the directory where the JAR file contains.</p>
     <p><strong>Why does <code>redirect:/bar/view</code> work?</strong></p>
     <p>Redirect make a new request to the server, and then resolves the view name using the same rules as before.</p>
     <p>It's good to use relative paths to prevent ambiguities.</p>
     <p>Some information you can find <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.0.0.M3/reference/html/ch16s05.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Spring. Views and resolving them</a></p>

        <td><span>"If you are using view without a leading slash <code>view</code> then Spring treats it as a <code>relative path</code> and looks for the view <b>from the current directory</b>." From the current directory of the URL? @RAI this part is still a little confusing. If I have a controller mapped to <code>/foo/bar</code> and the view is stored in <code>…/templates/foo/view</code>, then returning <code>view</code> as the view doesn't work, even though it's at the same directory level as <code>/foo/bar</code> in the URL path. I have to return <code>foo/view</code> and just remember that this is apparently relative to the root of my context, not of the "current directory".</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Garret Wilson</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">7 May 2023 at 22:00</span></td>
