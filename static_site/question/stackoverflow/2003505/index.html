     <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
     <pre><code>git push -d &lt;remote_name&gt; &lt;branchname&gt;
git branch -d &lt;branchname&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> In most cases, <code>&lt;remote_name&gt;</code> will be <code>origin</code>.</p>
     <h1>Delete Local Branch</h1>
     <p>To delete the <em><strong>local</strong></em> branch, use one of the following:</p>
     <pre><code>git branch -d &lt;branch_name&gt;
git branch -D &lt;branch_name&gt;
</code></pre>
     <ul>
      <li>The <code>-d</code> option is an alias for <code>--delete</code>, which only deletes the branch if it has already been fully merged in its upstream branch.</li>
      <li>The <code>-D</code> option is an alias for <code>--delete --force</code>, which deletes the branch "irrespective of its merged status." [Source: <code>man git-branch</code>]</li>
      <li>As of <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.3.0.txt" rel="noreferrer">Git v2.3</a>, <code>git branch -d</code> (delete) learned to honor the <code>-f</code> (force) flag.</li>
      <li>You will receive an error if you try to delete the currently selected branch.</li>
     </ul>
     <h1>Delete Remote Branch</h1>
     <p>As of <a href="https://github.com/gitster/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/1.7.0.txt" rel="noreferrer">Git v1.7.0</a>, you can delete a <em><strong>remote</strong></em> branch using</p>
     <pre><code>$ git push &lt;remote_name&gt; --delete &lt;branch_name&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>which might be easier to remember than</p>
     <pre><code>$ git push &lt;remote_name&gt; :&lt;branch_name&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>which was added in <a href="https://github.com/gitster/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/1.5.0.txt" rel="noreferrer">Git v1.5.0</a> "to delete a remote branch or a tag."</p>
     <p>Starting with <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt" rel="noreferrer">Git v2.8.0</a>, you can also use <code>git push</code> with the <code>-d</code> option as an alias for <code>--delete</code>. Therefore, the version of Git you have installed will dictate whether you need to use the easier or harder syntax.</p>
     <h2>Delete Remote Branch [Original Answer from 5-Jan-2010]</h2>
     <p>From Chapter 3 of <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches" rel="noreferrer"><em>Pro Git</em></a> by Scott Chacon:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <h3>Deleting Remote Branches</h3>
      <p>Suppose you’re done with a remote branch — say, you and your collaborators are finished with a feature and have merged it into your remote’s main branch (or whatever branch your stable code-line is in). You can delete a remote branch using the rather obtuse syntax <code>git push [remotename] :[branch]</code>. If you want to delete your <code>serverfix</code> branch from the server, you run the following:</p>
      <pre><code>$ git push origin :serverfix
To git@github.com:schacon/simplegit.git
 - [deleted]         serverfix
</code></pre>
      <p>Boom. No more branches on your server. You may want to dog-ear this page, because you’ll need that command, and you’ll likely forget the syntax. A way to remember this command is by recalling the <code>git push [remotename] [localbranch]:[remotebranch]</code> syntax that we went over a bit earlier. If you leave off the <code>[localbranch]</code> portion, then you’re basically saying, “Take nothing on my side and make it be <code>[remotebranch]</code>.”</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>I ran <code>git push origin :bugfix</code>, and it worked beautifully. Scott Chacon was right—I will want to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dogear#Verb" rel="noreferrer">dog-ear</a> that page (or virtually dog ear-by answering this on Stack&nbsp;Overflow).</p>
     <p>Finally, execute the following on other machines to propagate changes:</p>
     <pre><code># Fetch changes from all remotes and locally delete 
# remote deleted branches/tags etc
# --prune will do the job :-;
git fetch --all --prune
</code></pre>

     <p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/2003515/2637261">Matthew’s answer</a> is great for removing <em>remote</em> branches and I also appreciate the explanation, but to make a simple distinction between the two commands:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>to remove a <em><strong>local branch</strong></em> from your machine: <code>git branch -d {local_branch}</code> (use <code>-D</code> instead to force deleting the branch without checking merged status);</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>to remove a <em><strong>remote branch</strong></em> from the server: <code>git push origin -d {remote_branch}</code>.</p></li>

     <h2>The <em>short answers</em></h2>
     <p>If you want more detailed explanations of the following commands, then see the long answers in the next section.</p>
     <h3>Deleting a remote branch</h3>
     <pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git push origin --delete &lt;branch&gt;  # Git version 1.7.0 or newer
git push origin -d &lt;branch&gt;        # Shorter version (Git 1.7.0 or newer)
git push origin :&lt;branch&gt;          # Git versions older than 1.7.0
</code></pre>
     <h3>Deleting a local branch</h3>
     <pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git branch --delete &lt;branch&gt;
git branch -d &lt;branch&gt; # Shorter version
git branch -D &lt;branch&gt; # Force-delete un-merged branches
</code></pre>
     <h3>Deleting a local remote-tracking branch</h3>
     <pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git branch --delete --remotes &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;
git branch -dr &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt; # Shorter

git fetch &lt;remote&gt; --prune # Delete multiple obsolete remote-tracking branches
git fetch &lt;remote&gt; -p      # Shorter
</code></pre>
     <hr>
     <h2>The <em>long answer</em>: there are three different branches to delete!</h2>
     <p>When you're dealing with deleting branches both locally and remotely, keep in mind that <strong>there are three different branches involved</strong>:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>The local branch <code>X</code>.</li>
      <li>The remote origin branch <code>X</code>.</li>
      <li>The local remote-tracking branch <code>origin/X</code> that tracks the remote branch <code>X</code>.</li>
     </ol>
     <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NLAqw.png" alt="Visualization of three branches"></p>
     <p>The original poster used:</p>
     <pre><code>git branch -rd origin/bugfix
</code></pre>
     <p>Which only deleted his <strong>local remote-tracking branch</strong> <code>origin/bugfix</code>, and not the actual remote branch <code>bugfix</code> on <code>origin</code>.</p>
     <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iCOnz.png" alt="Diagram 2"></p>
     <p><strong>To delete that actual remote branch</strong>, you need</p>
     <pre><code>git push origin --delete bugfix
</code></pre>
     <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Z3GY.png" alt="Diagram 3"></p>
     <h3>Additional details</h3>
     <p>The following sections describe additional details to consider when deleting your remote and remote-tracking branches.</p>
     <h2>Pushing to delete remote branches also removes remote-tracking branches</h2>
     <p>Note that deleting the remote branch <code>X</code> from the command line using a <code>git push</code> <strong>will also remove the local remote-tracking branch</strong> <code>origin/X</code>, so it is not necessary to prune the obsolete remote-tracking branch with <code>git fetch --prune</code> or <code>git fetch -p</code>. However, it wouldn't hurt if you did it anyway.</p>
     <p>You can verify that the remote-tracking branch <code>origin/X</code> was also deleted by running the following:</p>
     <pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code># View just remote-tracking branches
git branch --remotes
git branch -r

# View both strictly local as well as remote-tracking branches
git branch --all
git branch -a
</code></pre>
     <h2>Pruning the obsolete local remote-tracking branch origin/X</h2>
     <p>If you didn't delete your remote branch <code>X</code> from the command line (like above), then your local repository will still contain (a now obsolete) remote-tracking branch <code>origin/X</code>. This can happen if you deleted a remote branch directly through GitHub's web interface, for example.</p>
     <p>A typical way to remove these obsolete remote-tracking branches (since Git version 1.6.6) is to simply run <code>git fetch</code> with the <code>--prune</code> or shorter <code>-p</code>. <strong>Note that this removes all obsolete local remote-tracking branches for any remote branches that no longer exist on the remote</strong>:</p>
     <pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git fetch origin --prune
git fetch origin -p # Shorter
</code></pre>
     <p>Here is the relevant quote from the <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.0.0/Documentation/RelNotes/1.6.6.txt#L162-L166" rel="noreferrer">1.6.6 release notes</a> (emphasis mine):</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p><strong>"git fetch" learned</strong> <code>--all</code> and <code>--multiple </code>options, to run fetch from many repositories, and <strong><code>--prune</code> option to remove remote tracking branches that went stale.</strong> These make "git remote update" and "git remote prune" less necessary (there is no plan to remove "remote update" nor "remote prune", though).</p>
     </blockquote>
     <h3>Alternative to above automatic pruning for obsolete remote-tracking branches</h3>
     <p>Alternatively, instead of pruning your obsolete local remote-tracking branches through <code>git fetch -p</code>, <em>you can avoid making the extra network operation</em> by just manually removing the branch(es) with the <code>--remotes</code> or <code>-r</code> flags:</p>
     <pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git branch --delete --remotes origin/X
git branch -dr origin/X # Shorter
</code></pre>

     <h3>Steps for deleting a branch:</h3>
     <p>For deleting the <strong>remote branch:</strong></p>
     <pre><code>git push origin --delete &lt;your_branch&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>For deleting the <strong>local branch</strong>, you have <strong>three ways</strong>:</p>
     <pre><code>1: git branch -D &lt;branch_name&gt;

2: git branch --delete --force &lt;branch_name&gt;  # Same as -D

3: git branch --delete  &lt;branch_name&gt;         # Error on unmerge
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>Explain:</strong> OK, just explain what's going on here!</p>
     <p>Simply do <code>git push origin --delete</code> to <strong>delete your remote branch <em>only</em></strong>, add the name of the branch at the end and this will delete and <strong>push it to remote</strong> at the same time...</p>
     <p>Also, <code>git branch -D</code>, which simply delete the local branch <strong><em>only</em></strong>!...</p>
     <p><code>-D</code> stands for <code>--delete --force</code> which will delete the branch even it's not merged (force delete), but you can also use <code>-d</code> which stands for <code>--delete</code> which throw an error respective of the branch merge status...</p>
     <p>I also create the <strong>image below</strong> to show the steps:</p>

     <p>It's very simple:</p>
     <p><strong>To delete the remote branch</strong></p>
     <pre><code>git push -d origin &lt;branch-name&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p><em>Or</em></p>
     <pre><code>git push origin :&lt;branch-name&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>-- You can also delete tags with this syntax</p>
     <p><strong>To forcefully delete local branch</strong></p>
     <pre><code>git branch -D &lt;branch-name&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> do a <code>git fetch --all --prune</code> on other machines after deleting remote branch, to remove obsolete tracking branches.</p>
     <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
     <p>to remove local branch</p>
     <pre><code>git branch -D my-local-branch
</code></pre>
     <p>to remove remote branch</p>
     <pre><code>git push origin :my-remote-branch
</code></pre>
     <p>With the new version of git, its also possible to remove branch with</p>
     <pre><code>git push origin --delete &lt;branch_name&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>TIP:</strong> if you want to see all available branches you can use <code>git branch -a</code>,</p>
     <p>and to see just remote branches, you can use <code>git branch -r</code></p>

     <p>Tip: When you delete branches using</p>
     <pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git branch -d &lt;branchname&gt; # Deletes local branch
</code></pre>
     <p>or</p>
     <pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git push origin :&lt;branchname&gt; # Deletes remote branch
</code></pre>
     <p>only the references are deleted. Even though the branch is actually removed on the remote, the references to it still exists in the local repositories of your team members. This means that for other team members the deleted branches are still visible when they do a <code>git branch -a</code>.</p>
     <p>To solve this, your team members can prune the deleted branches with</p>
     <pre><code>git remote prune &lt;repository&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>This is typically <code>git remote prune origin</code>.</p>

     <p>Another approach is:</p>
     <pre><code>git push --prune origin
</code></pre>
     <p><strong><em>WARNING:</em></strong> <em>This will delete all remote branches that do not exist locally.</em> Or more comprehensively,</p>
     <pre><code>git push --mirror

     <p>will effectively make the remote repository look like the local copy of the repository (local heads, remotes and tags are mirrored on remote).</p>

     <p>If you want to complete both these steps with a single command, you can make an alias for it by adding the below to your <code>~/.gitconfig</code>:</p>
     <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>[alias]
    rmbranch = "!f(){ git branch -d ${1} &amp;&amp; git push origin --delete ${1}; };f"
</code></pre>
     <p>Alternatively, you can add this to your global configuration from the command line using</p>
     <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>git config --global alias.rmbranch \
'!f(){ git branch -d ${1} &amp;&amp; git push origin --delete ${1}; };f'
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If using <code>-d</code> (lowercase d), the branch will only be deleted if it has been merged. To force the delete to happen, you will need to use <code>-D</code> (uppercase D).</p>

     <p>You can also do this using <code>git remote prune origin</code></p>
     <pre><code>$ git remote prune origin
Pruning origin
URL: git@example.com/yourrepo.git
 * [pruned] origin/some-branchs
</code></pre>
     <p>It prunes and deletes remote-tracking branches from a <code>git branch -r</code> listing.</p>

     <p>In addition to the other answers, I often use the <a href="https://github.com/webmat/git_remote_branch" rel="noreferrer">git_remote_branch</a> tool. It's an extra install, but it gets you a convenient way to interact with remote branches. In this case, to delete:</p>
     <pre><code>grb delete branch
</code></pre>
     <p>I find that I also use the <code>publish</code> and <code>track</code> commands quite often.</p>

     <p><strong>To delete <em>locally</em> - (normal)</strong></p>
     <pre><code>git branch -d my_branch
</code></pre>
     <p>If your branch is in a rebasing/merging progress and that was not done properly, it means you will get an error, <code>Rebase/Merge in progress</code>, so in that case, you won't be able to delete your branch.</p>
     <p>So either you need to solve the rebasing/merging. Otherwise, you can do force <em>delete</em> by using,</p>
     <pre><code>git branch -D my_branch
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>To delete in <em>remote</em>:</strong></p>
     <pre><code>git push --delete origin my_branch
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>You can do the same using:</strong></p>
     <pre><code>git push origin :my_branch   # Easy to remember both will do the same.
</code></pre>

     <p>Many of the other answers will lead to errors/warnings. This approach is relatively fool proof although you may still need <code>git branch -D branch_to_delete</code> if it's not fully merged into <code>some_other_branch</code>, for example.</p>
     <pre><code>git checkout some_other_branch
git push origin :branch_to_delete
git branch -d branch_to_delete
</code></pre>
     <p>Remote pruning isn't needed if you deleted the remote branch. It's only used to get the most up-to-date remotes available on a repository you're tracking. I've observed <code>git fetch</code> will add remotes, not remove them. Here's an example of when <code>git remote prune origin</code> will actually do something:</p>
     <p>User A does the steps above. User B would run the following commands to see the most up-to-date remote branches:</p>
     <pre><code>git fetch
git remote prune origin
git branch -r
</code></pre>

     <p>I got sick of googling for this answer, so I took a similar approach to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/15775364/551436">the answer that crizCraig posted</a> earlier.</p>
     <p>I added the following to my Bash profile:</p>
     <pre><code>function gitdelete(){
    git push origin --delete $1
    git branch -D $1
}
</code></pre>
     <p>Then every time I'm done with a branch (merged into <code>master</code>, for example) I run the following in my terminal:</p>
     <pre><code>gitdelete my-branch-name
</code></pre>
     <p>...which then deletes <code>my-branch-name</code> from <code>origin</code> as as well as locally.</p>

     <p>An alternative option to the command line for deleting remote branches is the <strong>GitHub branches page</strong>.</p>
     <p>See for example: <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/branches" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/angular/angular.js/branches</a></p>
     <p>Found in the <code>Code</code> -&gt; <code>Branches</code> page of a GitHub repository.</p>
     <p>I generally prefer command line myself but this <strong>GitHub page shows you lots more information</strong> about the branches, such as <strong>last updated date and user</strong>, and <strong>number of commits ahead and behind</strong>. It is useful when dealing with a large number of branches.</p>

     <p>There are good answers, but, in case that you have a ton of branches, deleting them one by one locally and remotely, would be a tedious tasks. You can use this script to automate these tasks.</p>
     <pre><code>branch_not_delete=( "master" "develop" "our-branch-1" "our-branch-2")

for branch in `git branch -a | grep remotes | grep -v HEAD | grep -v master`; do

    # Delete prefix remotes/origin/ from branch name
    branch_name="$(awk '{gsub("remotes/origin/", "");print}' &lt;&lt;&lt; $branch)"

    if ! [[ " ${branch_not_delete[*]} " == *" $branch_name "* ]]; then
        # Delete branch remotly and locally
        git push origin :$branch_name
    fi
done
</code></pre>
     <ul>
      <li>List the branches that you don't want to delete</li>
      <li>Iterate over the remote's branches and if they aren't in our "preserve list", deleted them.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>Using <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1053633">Git Bash</a> you can execute the following:</p>
     <pre><code>git branch --delete &lt;branch&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>Or</p>
     <p>-</p>
     <p>From the GitHub desktop application, when you have the branch checked out, you can delete the <strong>local</strong> branch via the <em>Branch</em> menu strip:</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b6dQg.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b6dQg.png" alt="Enter image description here"></a></p>
     <p>If you <strong><em>are not</em></strong> using the GitHub desktop application and are using an IDE like Visual Studio for your local source control, all you have to do is a couple of quick steps:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Check out a branch other than the one you wish to delete.</li>
      <li>Right-click the branch you wish to delete.</li>
      <li>Select the <strong>Delete</strong> option from the context menu.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Then, once logged in to your GitHub account online, go to the repository and click the <strong><em>All Branches</em></strong> tab. From there, just click the little trash can icon on the right on the name of the branch you wish to delete.</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hbXpP.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hbXpP.png" alt="Enter image description here"></a></p>
     <p>*Keep in mind - if the branch isn't published, there isn't any need to try to delete it from your online repository.</p>

     <p>The most flexible way is to use a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/10978257/244297">custom Git command</a>. For example, create the following Python script somewhere in your <code>$PATH</code> under the name <code>git-rmbranch</code> and make it executable:</p>
     <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import argparse
import subprocess
import sys

def rmbranch(branch_name, remote, force):
    try:
        print(subprocess.run(['git', 'branch', '-D' if force else '-d', branch_name],
                             capture_output=True, check=True, encoding='utf-8').stdout, end='')
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as exc:
        print(exc.stderr.replace(f'git branch -D {branch_name}', f'git rmbranch -f {branch_name}'), end='')
        return exc.returncode

    return subprocess.run(['git', 'push', remote, '--delete', branch_name]).returncode    

if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Delete a Git branch locally and remotely.')
    parser.add_argument('-r', '--remote', default='origin', help="The remote name (defaults to 'origin')")
    parser.add_argument('-f', '--force', action='store_true', help='Force deletion of not fully merged branches')
    parser.add_argument('branch_name', help='The branch name')
    args = parser.parse_args()

    sys.exit(rmbranch(args.branch_name, args.remote, args.force))
</code></pre>
     <p>Then <code>git rmbranch -h</code> will show you usage information:</p>
     <pre><code>usage: git-rmbranch [-h] [-r REMOTE] [-f] branch_name

Delete a Git branch locally and remotely.

positional arguments:
  branch_name           The branch name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r REMOTE, --remote REMOTE
                        The remote name (defaults to 'origin')
  -f, --force           Force deletion of not fully merged branches
</code></pre>
     <p>Note that <code>git push origin --delete &lt;branch_name&gt;</code> also removes the local remote-tracking branch (<code>origin/&lt;branch_name&gt;</code> by default), so no need to care about that.</p>
     <p>P.S. You can find the latest version of this Git command <a href="https://github.com/yarmash/git-rmbranch/blob/master/git-rmbranch" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. Comments and suggestions are welcome.</p>

     <p>The first few methods did not work for me.</p>
     <p>Let’s say you have the following branch and remote branch,</p>
     <pre><code>Local : Test_Branch
Remote: remotes/origin/feature/Test_FE
</code></pre>
     <p>Set the upstream correctly for your local branch to track the remote branch you want to delete.</p>
     <pre><code>git branch --set-upstream-to=remotes/origin/feature/Test_FE Test_Branch
</code></pre>
     <p>Then to delete the remote branch execute this</p>
     <pre><code>git push origin --delete Test_Branch
</code></pre>
     <p>Then to delete the local branch execute following command</p>
     <pre><code>git branch -D Test_Branch
</code></pre>
     <p>That's it.</p>

     <p>Both <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17864475/228738">CoolAJ86's</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1307969/2227298">apenwarr's</a> answers are very similar. I went back and forth between the two trying to understand the better approach to support a submodule replacement. Below is a combination of them.</p>
     <p>First navigate Git Bash to the root of the Git repository to be split. In my example here that is <code>~/Documents/OriginalRepo (master)</code></p>
     <pre><code># Move the folder at prefix to a new branch
git subtree split --prefix=SubFolderName/FolderToBeNewRepo --branch=to-be-new-repo

# Create a new repository out of the newly made branch
mkdir ~/Documents/NewRepo
pushd ~/Documents/NewRepo
git init
git pull ~/Documents/OriginalRepo to-be-new-repo

# Upload the new repository to a place that should be referenced for submodules
git remote add origin git@github.com:myUsername/newRepo.git
git push -u origin master
popd

# Replace the folder with a submodule
git rm -rf ./SubFolderName/FolderToBeNewRepo
git submodule add git@github.com:myUsername/newRepo.git SubFolderName/FolderToBeNewRepo
git branch --delete --force to-be-new-repo
</code></pre>
     <p>Below is a copy of above with the customize-able names replaced and using HTTPS instead. The root folder is now <code>~/Documents/_Shawn/UnityProjects/SoProject (master)</code></p>
     <pre><code># Move the folder at prefix to a new branch
git subtree split --prefix=Assets/SoArchitecture --branch=so-package

# Create a new repository out of the newly made branch
mkdir ~/Documents/_Shawn/UnityProjects/SoArchitecture
pushd ~/Documents/_Shawn/UnityProjects/SoArchitecture
git init
git pull ~/Documents/_Shawn/UnityProjects/SoProject so-package

# Upload the new repository to a place that should be referenced for submodules
git remote add origin https://github.com/Feddas/SoArchitecture.git
git push -u origin master
popd

# Replace the folder with a submodule
git rm -rf ./Assets/SoArchitecture
git submodule add https://github.com/Feddas/SoArchitecture.git
git branch --delete --force so-package
</code></pre>

     <p>Here you can delete remote branches corresponding to a glob or any branch name:</p>
     <pre><code>git branch -r --list "origin/*" | xargs git branch -r -D

     <p>a quick and concise method to delete a git branch both locally and remotely is:</p>
     <pre><code>git branch -d YourBranchName &amp;&amp; git push -d origin YourBranchName 
</code></pre>
     <p>The image below shows a performed example along with the git confirmation message.</p>
