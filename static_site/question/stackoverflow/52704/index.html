     <p>Another quicker way is:</p>
     <pre><code>git stash save --keep-index --include-untracked
</code></pre>
     <p>You don't need to include <code>--include-untracked</code> if you don't want to be thorough about it.</p>
     <p>After that, you can drop that stash with a <code>git stash drop</code> command if you like.</p>

     <h3>2019 update</h3>
     <p>You can now discard unstaged changes in <strong>one tracked file</strong> with:</p>
     <pre><code>git restore &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>
     <p>and in <strong>all tracked files</strong> in the current directory (recursively) with:</p>
     <pre><code>git restore .
</code></pre>
     <p>If you run the latter from the root of the repository, it will discard unstaged changes in all tracked files in the project.</p>
     <h3>Notes</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><code>git restore</code> was introduced in <a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/f496b064fc1135e0dded7f93d85d72eb0b302c22" rel="noreferrer">July 2019</a> and released in version 2.23 as part of a split of the <code>git checkout</code> command into <code>git restore</code> for files and <code>git switch</code> for branches.</li>
      <li><code>git checkout</code> still behaves as it used to and the older answers remain perfectly valid.</li>
      <li>When running <code>git status</code> with unstaged changes in the working tree, this is now what Git suggests to use to discard them (instead of <code>git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;</code> as it used to prior to v2.23).</li>
      <li>As with <code>git checkout -- .</code>, this only discards changes in tracked files. So <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/12184274/9210961">Mariusz Nowak's answer</a> still applies and if you want to discard all unstaged changes, including untracked files, you could run, as he suggests, an additional <code>git clean -df</code>.</li>

     <p>Since no answer suggests the exact option combination that I use, here it is:</p>
     <pre><code>git clean -dxn .  # dry-run to inspect the list of files-to-be-removed
git clean -dxf .  # REMOVE ignored/untracked files (in the current directory)
git checkout -- . # ERASE changes in tracked files (in the current directory)
</code></pre>
     <p>This is the online help text for the used <code>git clean</code> options:</p>
     <p><code>-d</code></p>
     <p>Remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files. If an untracked directory is managed by a different Git repository, it is not removed by default. Use <code>-f</code> option twice if you really want to remove such a directory.</p>
     <p><code>-x</code></p>
     <p>Don’t use the standard ignore rules read from <code>.gitignore</code> (per directory) and <code>$GIT_DIR/info/exclude</code>, but do still use the ignore rules given with <code>-e</code> options. This allows removing all untracked files, including build products. This can be used (possibly in conjunction with <code>git reset</code>) to create a pristine working directory to test a clean build.</p>
     <p><code>-n</code></p>
     <p>Don’t actually remove anything, just show what would be done.</p>
     <p><code>-f</code></p>
     <p>If the Git configuration variable <code>clean.requireForce</code> is not set to <code>false</code>, Git clean will refuse to delete files or directories unless given <code>-f</code>, <code>-n</code>, or <code>-i</code>. Git will refuse to delete directories within the <code>.git</code> subdirectory or file, unless a second <code>-f</code> is given.</p>

     <p>If you merely wish <strong>to remove changes to existing files</strong>, use <code>checkout</code> (<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout" rel="noreferrer">documented here</a>).</p>

     <p>I really found this article helpful for explaining when to use what command: <a href="http://www.szakmeister.net/blog/2011/oct/12/reverting-changes-git/" rel="noreferrer">http://www.szakmeister.net/blog/2011/oct/12/reverting-changes-git/</a></p>
     <p>There are a couple different cases:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>If you haven't staged the file, then you use <code>git checkout</code>. Checkout "updates files in the working tree to match the version in the index". If the files have not been staged (aka added to the index)... this command will essentially revert the files to what your last commit was.</p>
       <p><code>git checkout -- foo.txt</code></p></li>
      <li>
       <p>If you have staged the file, then use git reset. Reset changes the index to match a commit.</p>
       <p><code>git reset -- foo.txt</code></p></li>
     </ol>
     <p>I suspect that using <code>git stash</code> is a popular choice since it's a little less dangerous. You can always go back to it if you accidently blow too much away when using git reset. Reset is recursive by default.</p>
     <p>Take a look at the article above for further advice.</p>

     <p>If you aren't interested in keeping the unstaged changes (especially if the staged changes are new files), I found this handy:</p>
     <pre><code>git diff | git apply --reverse

     <p>You can use git stash - if something goes wrong, you can still revert from the stash. Similar to some other answer here, but this one also removes all unstaged files and also all unstaged deletes:</p>
     <pre><code>git add .
git stash
</code></pre>
     <p>if you check that everything is OK, throw the stash away:</p>
     <pre><code>git stash drop
</code></pre>
     <p>The answer from Bilal Maqsood with <code>git clean</code> also worked for me, but with the stash I have more control - if I do sth accidentally, I can still get my changes back</p>
     <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
     <p>I think there is 1 more change (don't know why this worked for me before):</p>
     <p><code>git add . -A</code> instead of <code>git add .</code></p>
     <p>without the <code>-A</code> the removed files will not be staged</p>

     <p>When switching branches, proceed even if the index or the working tree differs from HEAD. This is used to throw away local changes.</p>
     <p>When checking out paths from the index, do not fail upon unmerged entries; instead, unmerged entries are ignored.</p>

     <p>Instead of discarding changes, I reset my remote to the origin. Note - this method is to completely restore your folder to that of the repo.</p>
     <p>So I do this to make sure they don't sit there when I git reset (later - excludes gitignores on the Origin/branchname)</p>
     <p>NOTE: If you want to keep files not yet tracked, but not in GITIGNORE you may wish to skip this step, as it will Wipe these untracked files not found on your remote repository (thanks @XtrmJosh).</p>
     <pre><code>git add --all
</code></pre>
     <p>Then I</p>
     <pre><code>git fetch --all
</code></pre>
     <p>Then I reset to origin</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard origin/branchname
</code></pre>
     <p>That will put it back to square one. Just like RE-Cloning the branch, WHILE keeping all my gitignored files locally and in place.</p>
     <p>Updated per user comment below: Variation to reset the to whatever current branch the user is on.</p>
     <pre><code>git reset --hard @{u}

     <p>Just use:</p>
     <pre><code>git stash -u
</code></pre>
     <p>Done. Easy.</p>
     <p>If you <em>really</em> care about your stash stack then you can follow with <code>git stash drop</code>. But at that point you're better off using (from Mariusz Nowak):</p>
     <pre><code>git checkout -- .
git clean -df
</code></pre>
     <p>Nonetheless, I like <code>git stash -u</code> the best because it "discards" all tracked and untracked changes in just <em>one command</em>. Yet <code>git checkout -- .</code> only discards tracked changes, and <code>git clean -df</code> only discards untracked changes... and typing both commands is <em>far</em> too much work :)</p>

     <p>In my opinion,</p>
     <pre><code>git clean -df
</code></pre>
     <p>should do the trick. As per <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clean/2.2.0">Git documentation on git clean</a></p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>git-clean - Remove untracked files from the working tree</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>Cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are not under version control, starting from the current directory.</p>
      <p>Normally, only files unknown to Git are removed, but if the -x option is specified, ignored files are also removed. This can, for example, be useful to remove all build products.</p>
      <p>If any optional ... arguments are given, only those paths are affected.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p><strong>Options</strong></p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>-d Remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files. If an untracked directory is managed by a different Git repository, it is not removed by default. Use -f option twice if you really want to remove such a directory.</p>
      <p>-f --force If the Git configuration variable clean.requireForce is not set to false, git clean will refuse to run unless given -f, -n or -i.</p>

     <p>Another way to get rid of new files that is more specific than git clean -df (it will allow you to get rid of some files not necessarily all), is to add the new files to the index first, then stash, then drop the stash.</p>
     <p>This technique is useful when, for some reason, you can't easily delete all of the untracked files by some ordinary mechanism (like rm).</p>

     <p>What follows is really only a solution if you are working with a fork of a repository where you regularly synchronize (e.g. pull request) with another repo. Short answer: delete fork and refork, but <strong>read the warnings on github</strong>.</p>
     <p>I had a similar problem, perhaps not identical, and I'm sad to say my solution is not ideal, but it is ultimately effective.</p>
     <p>I would often have git status messages like this (involving at least 2/4 files):</p>
     <pre><code>$ git status
# Not currently on any branch.
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#       modified:   doc/PROJECT/MEDIUM/ATS-constraint/constraint_s2var.dats
#       modified:   doc/PROJECT/MEDIUM/ATS-constraint/parsing/parsing_s2var.dats
#
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#       modified:   doc/PROJECT/MEDIUM/ATS-constraint/constraint_s2Var.dats
#       modified:   doc/PROJECT/MEDIUM/ATS-constraint/parsing/parsing_s2Var.dats
</code></pre>
     <p>A keen eye will note that these files have dopplegangers that are a single letter in case off. Somehow, and I have no idea what led me down this path to start with (as I was not working with these files myself from the upstream repo), I had switched these files. Try the many solutions listed on this page (and other pages) did not seem to help.</p>
     <p><strong>I was able to fix the problem by deleting my forked repository and all local repositories, and reforking. This alone was not enough; upstream had to rename the files in question to new filenames.</strong> As long as you don't have any uncommited work, no wikis, and no issues that diverge from the upstream repository, you should be just fine. Upstream may not be very happy with you, to say the least. As for my problem, it is undoubtedly a user error as I'm not that proficient with git, but the fact that it is far from easy to fix points to an issue with git as well.</p>

     <p>You could create your own alias which describes how to do it in a descriptive way.</p>
     <p>I use the next alias to discard changes.</p>
     <hr>
     <h3>Discard changes in a (list of) file(s) in working tree</h3>
     <pre><code>discard = checkout --
</code></pre>
     <p>Then you can use it as next to discard all changes:</p>
     <pre><code>discard .
</code></pre>
     <p>Or just a file:</p>
     <pre><code>discard filename
</code></pre>
     <hr>
     <p>Otherwise, if you want to discard all changes and also the untracked files, I use a mix of checkout and clean:</p>
     <h3>Clean and discard changes and untracked files in working tree</h3>
     <pre><code>cleanout = !git clean -df &amp;&amp; git checkout -- .
</code></pre>
     <p>So the use is simple as next:</p>
     <pre><code>cleanout
</code></pre>
     <hr>
     <p>Now is available in the next Github repo which contains a lot of aliases:</p>
     <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/GitAlias/gitalias" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/GitAlias/gitalias</a></li>

     <p>This will discard any uncommitted changes to the branch. It won't reset it back if any changes were committed. This is handy when you've done some changes and decide you don't want them for some reason and you have NOT committed those changes. It actually just checks out the branch again and discards any current uncommitted changes.</p>

     <p>If all the staged files were actually committed, then the branch can simply be reset e.g. from your GUI with about three mouse clicks: <strong>Branch</strong>, <strong>Reset</strong>, <strong>Yes</strong>!</p>
     <p>So what I often do in practice to revert unwanted local changes is to commit all the good stuff, and then reset the branch.</p>
     <p>If the good stuff is committed in a single commit, then you can use "amend last commit" to bring it back to being staged or unstaged if you'd ultimately like to commit it a little differently.</p>
     <p>This might not be the technical solution you are looking for to your problem, but I find it a very practical solution. It allows you to discard unstaged changes selectively, resetting the changes you don't like and keeping the ones you do.</p>
     <p>So in summary, I simply do <strong>commit</strong>, <strong>branch reset</strong>, and <strong>amend last commit</strong>.</p>

     <p>Just as a reminder, newer versions of git has the restore command, which also is a suggestion when typing git status when you have changed files:</p>
     <p>(use "git add ..." to update what will be committed)</p>
     <p>(use "git restore ..." to discard changes in working directory)</p>
     <p>So git 'restore' is the modern solution to this. It is always a good idea to read the suggestions from git after typing 'git status' :-)</p>

     <p>Just use:</p>
     <pre><code>git stash -k -u
</code></pre>
     <p>This will stash <strong>unstaged changes</strong> and <strong>untracked files (new files)</strong> and keep staged files.</p>
     <p>It's better than <code>reset</code>/<code>checkout</code>/<code>clean</code>, because you might want them back later (by <code>git stash pop</code>). Keeping them in the stash is better than discarding them.</p>

     <p>To delete unstaged changes I tried "git restore ." as I was told by Git but it just didn't work. A very good way is to use:</p>
     <pre><code>git revert --hard
</code></pre>
     <p>It works perfectly. Its Git Help explains perfectly the point:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p><strong>--hard</strong> Resets the index and working tree. <strong>Any changes to tracked files in the working tree since are discarded.</strong> Any untracked files or directories in the way of writing any tracked files are simply deleted.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>PS: I am using git version 2.35.3.windows.1. I think quite some answers here made the issue over-complicated.</p>
