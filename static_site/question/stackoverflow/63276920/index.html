   <div>
    <p>I have a query <code>-license:"CC-BY-NC" AND -license:"CC-BY-ND 4.0 (Int)"</code> to be passed into PrecedenceQueryParser.parse like this:</p>
    <pre><code>Query query = new PrecedenceQueryParser().parse(filter, '')
</code></pre>
    <p>But in the generated query you can see, clauses are like <code>-lincense:CC-BY-NC</code>, "" are lost.</p>
    <p>Is there any settings to keep the ""?</p>
    <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zqp2W.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zqp2W.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
    <p>===================== UPDATE ===========================</p>
    <p>I understand that since I'm looking for a match of CC-BY-ND 4.0 (Int), without double quotes (double quotes are just used to make it a phrase). That's why query.clauses[1].query doesn't have "" around the CC-BY-ND 4.0 (Int)</p>
    <p>Now I do this:</p>
    <pre><code>    def bqb = new BooleanQuery.Builder()
    clauses.each { clause -&gt;
        bqb.add(clause.query, clause.prohibited ? BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD : BooleanClause.Occur.MUST_NOT)
    }

    String s = bqb.build().toString()
</code></pre>
    <p>build a BooleanQuery and put clauses together,</p>
    <p>the s then equals to <code>license:CC-BY-ND 4.0 (Int) license:CC-BY-NC</code></p>
    <p>This is definitely not what I want, I need CC-BY-ND 4.0 (Int) to be surrounded by double-quotes. Is there any way to do that?</p>
    <p>Gibbs's could be a solution but a bit tricky I think.</p>

     <p>Some additional information, to add to the answer provided by @gibbs:</p>
     <p>When using the <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/8_3_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#package.description" rel="nofollow noreferrer">classic query parser syntax</a> (which is what is being used in the question), then the following characters all have special meanings and therefore may need to be escaped, in any of the search terms where they appear:</p>
     <pre><code>+  -  &amp;&amp;  ||  !  (  )  {  }  [  ]  ^  "  ~  *  ?  :  \  /
</code></pre>
     <p>Note that in 2 cases, these are groups of characters: <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>.</p>
     <p>This list is documented <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/8_3_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#Escaping_Special_Characters" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
     <p>The easiest way to handle all these characters is to pass each search term to the <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/8_6_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/QueryParser.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">classic <code>QueryParser</code></a>, before building the search expression:</p>
     <pre><code>org.apache.lucene.queryparser.classic.QueryParser;
</code></pre>
     <p>For example:</p>
     <pre><code>String escapedSearchTerm = QueryParser.escape(searchTerm)
</code></pre>

     <p>You need to escape them.</p>
     <p>When you pass <code>-license:"CC-BY-NC" AND -license:"CC-BY-ND 4.0 (Int)"</code> this, use the below</p>
     <pre><code>-license:"\"CC-BY-NC\"" AND -license:"\"CC-BY-ND 4.0 (Int)\""
</code></pre>
