     <p><em><strong>Update</strong>: I have made some changes to the steps, and provided some notes about those changes at the end.</em></p>
     <hr>
     <p>I know the OP switched to using version 6, but here are the instructions for version 7:</p>
     <p>(Version 7.0.5, to be precise.)</p>
     <h2>Set-Up:</h2>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>Go to the "Getting Started" page <a href="https://javacc.github.io/javacc/#getting-started" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Download the zip file from the "Source(zip)" link.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Unzip that into a directory of your choosing. I chose a new empty directory <code>E:\javacc</code>. That ended up giving me everything in <code>E:\javacc\javacc-7.0.5</code>.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Create a new <code>target</code> directory. For me, that was <code>E:\javacc\javacc-7.0.5\target</code>.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p><em>NO NEED TO DO THIS</em>: Download the jar file from the "Getting Started" page, using the "Binaries" link. That gives you a file <code>javacc-7.0.5.jar</code>.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Locate the <code>javacc.jar</code> file in the <code>bootstrap</code> directory. Copy that file to the new <code>target</code> directory.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Add the <code>scripts</code> directory (for me: <code>E:\javacc\javacc-7.0.5\scripts</code>) to your <code>PATH</code> environment variable. I assume that does not need specific instructions.</p></li>
     </ol>
     <h2>Verify:</h2>
     <p>To test the installation:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>Open a <strong>new</strong> command prompt (to pick up the PATH changes), and navigate to the javacc installation directory (for me: <code>E:\javacc\javacc-7.0.5</code>).</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Execute the following command:</p></li>
     </ol>
     <pre><code>javacc
</code></pre>
     <p>This should give you a screenful of output, starting with:</p>
     <pre><code>E:\javacc\javacc-7.0.5&gt;java -cp target/javacc.jar javacc
Java Compiler Compiler Version 7.0.5 (Parser Generator)

Usage:
    javacc option-settings inputfile
</code></pre>
     <p>Similarly, you should be able to run the <code>jjdoc</code> and <code>jjtree</code> commands.</p>
     <hr>
     <p><strong>Update</strong></p>
     <p>The above steps were, indeed, unnecessarily complicated - as noted in comments. I have made some simplifications (used with v7.0.10). Those are shown above.</p>
     <p>The objective when using the JavaCC zip file is to be able to execute each JavaCC command (e.g. <code>javacc</code>) on the command line directly.</p>
     <p>You can run JavaCC commands using only the JAR file, as follows:</p>
     <pre><code>java -cp javacc.jar javacc
</code></pre>
     <p>Using this approach, you will not have access to <code>javacc</code> (or the other commands) directly on the command line: they will not be on your <code>PATH</code>.</p>

     <p>You can follow the same steps in the Installation part of the guide.</p>

     <p>After you have unzipped the downloaded file into a new directory, you need to add the path of the folder to your PATH variable in Windows. To do that, follow this guide:</p>

     <p>If you are using Eclipse as your IDE, you can install JavaCC from the marketplace. Just go to <code>help</code>, then click on <code>Eclipse Marketplace</code> and when it loads just type "JavaCC" on the search bar and install the plugin. I'm not sure if it's the latest version, but it works well and it's simpler to install.</p>
