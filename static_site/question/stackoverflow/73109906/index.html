    <p>Soo, i'm a IT Intern in a Company, and we need to transfer some data from a server to another by CMD commands like: <em><strong>"C:/Source" "D:/Target" /commands</strong></em> .... And we are doing that to move from a <strong>old server</strong> to a <strong>new one</strong> and make some space on the Disk to use for something else.</p>
    <p>The problem is there like <em>2000 lines of directory on Excel</em> to do that, and doing that manually gonna take ALOT of time and me and the other team have more stuff to do, i was wondering if i can create a <strong>automatic script to read the line</strong> on excel and do that line by line to save ALOT of time. Like changing the "<em>Source</em>" and "<em>Target</em>" inputs but keeping the other commands after.</p>
    <p>Thank alot!!!</p>

Can you not just create a formula in your Excel spreadsheet which <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/concatenate-function-8f8ae884-2ca8-4f7a-b093-75d702bea31d" rel="nofollow noreferrer">concatenates strings</a> together, to build all the commands you need?

     <p>Assuming you have a list of the source directories in column A of your spreadsheet, then you could use an Excel formula such as the following in column B (or wherever you want to place it):</p>
     <pre><code>=CONCAT("robocopy ", """", A1, """", " ", """", "G", RIGHT(A1, LEN(A1) -1), """", " /s /e /copyall /xo")
</code></pre>
     <p>Four double-quotes in a row result in one double-quote being generated as output.</p>
     <p>The formula <code>RIGHT(A1, LEN(A1) -1)</code> simply trims the leading <code>E</code> (directory) from the path, so it can be replaced with the target <code>G</code>.</p>
     <p>If A1 contains <code>E:\File\Example</code> then my formula generates the output:</p>
     <pre><code>robocopy "E:\File\Example" "G:\File\Example" /s /e /copyall /xo
</code></pre>
     <p>Copy that formula down for as many rows as you need, then copy/paste the results to a text file (you may need to use paste-special to paste the resulting text, not the formula.</p>
     <p>Rename the text file so it has a <code>.bat</code> file extension, so it is runnable from a CMD prompt. I would test the batch file with a very small number of commands first of all.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>This approach is fine, I would say, for a one-time (or few-times) exercise. If you were doing this many times, then yes an automated (Java, Python, etc.) approach may make more sense.</p>
     <hr>
     <p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
     <p>For your updated comment below, the relevant formula would be very similar to the one I provided above:</p>
     <pre><code>=CONCAT("robocopy ", """E:\apl_cad\", A1, """", " ", """\\ara1app2\ENG3\PROTEÍNAS\OldVersions\", A1, """", " /s /e /copyall /xo")
</code></pre>
     <p>If <code>A1</code> contains <code>X</code> then the formula generates the following:</p>
     <pre><code>robocopy "E:\apl_cad\x" "\\ara1app2\ENG3\PROTEÍNAS\OldVersions\x" /s /e /copyall /xo
</code></pre>
     <p>You can place that formula wherever you like - but make sure you adjust the cell references to <code>A1</code> so they match wherever the actual <code>X</code> data is located.</p>
