    <p>I have been doing Java SE for some years now and moving on to Java EE. However, I have some trouble understanding some aspects of Java EE.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>Is Java EE just a specification? What I mean is: Is EJB Java EE?</p></li>
     <li>
      <p>Are EJB/Spring different implementations of Java EE?</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>I am sorry to ask but I have some difficulties to understand what Java EE is.</p>
    <p><strong>Could someone explain what Java EE is? And EJB?</strong></p>

     <p>First of all, "Java EE" has since Sep 2019 been renamed to "<strong>Jakarta EE</strong>", starting with version 8. Historically, there was also the term "J2EE" which covered versions 1.2 until 1.4. The term "Java EE" covered versions 5 until 8. See also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_EE#History" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Jakarta EE, History on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

     <blockquote>
      <p><em>Is Jakarta EE just a specification? What I mean is: Is EJB Jakarta EE?</em></p>
     </blockquote>
     <p><a href="https://jakarta.ee" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Jakarta EE</a> is indeed an <strong>abstract</strong> specification. Anybody is open to develop and provide a working <a href="https://jakarta.ee/compatibility/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">implementation</a> of the specification. The <em>concrete</em> implementations are the so-called application servers, like <a href="https://wildfly.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">WildFly</a>, <a href="https://tomee.apache.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TomEE</a>, <a href="https://glassfish.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GlassFish</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-liberty" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Liberty</a>, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/weblogic.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">WebLogic</a>, etc. There are also servlet containers which implement only the JSP/Servlet part of the huge Jakarta EE API, such as <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Tomcat</a>, <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Jetty</a>, etc.</p>
     <p>We, Jakarta EE developers, should write code utilizing the specification (i.e. import <em>only</em> <code>jakarta.*</code> classes in our code instead of implementation specific classes such as <code>org.jboss.wildfly.*</code>, <code>com.sun.glassfish.*</code>, <code>org.apache.tomcat.*</code>, etc) and then we'll be able to run our code on any implementation (thus, on any application server). If you're familiar with JDBC, it's basically the same concept as how JDBC drivers work. See also a.o. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7550612/in-simplest-terms-what-is-a-factory">In simplest terms, what is a factory?</a></p>
     <p>EJB is part of the Jakarta EE specification. Look, <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/enterprise-beans/4.0/apidocs/jakarta/ejb/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">it's in the Jakarta EE API</a>. Full-fledged Jakarta EE application servers support it out the box, but simple JSP/Servlet containers don't.</p>

     <blockquote>
      <p><em>Are EJB/Spring different implementations of Jakarta EE?</em></p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>No, as said, EJB is part of Jakarta EE. Spring is a standalone framework which substitutes and improves many parts of Jakarta EE. Spring doesn't necessarily require Jakarta EE to run. A bare-bones servlet container like Tomcat is already sufficient. Simply put, Spring is a competitor of Jakarta EE. E.g. "Spring" (standalone) competes EJB/JTA, Spring MVC competes Faces/REST/MVC, Spring DI/IoC/AOP competes CDI, Spring Security competes JASPIC/Security, Spring Boot competes MicroProfile, etc.</p>
     <p>Back during the old J2EE/EJB2 times, the EJB2 API was terrible to implement and maintain. Spring was then a much better alternative to EJB2. But since EJB3 (Java EE 5), the EJB API was much improved based on lessons learnt from Spring. Since CDI (Java EE 6), there's not really a reason to look at again <em>another</em> framework like Spring to make the developers more easy as to developing among others the service layer.</p>
     <p>Only when you're using a bare-bones servlet container such as Tomcat and can't move on to a Jakarta EE server, then Spring is more attractive as it's easier to install Spring on Tomcat. It isn't possible to install e.g. an EJB container on Tomcat without modifying the server itself, you would basically be reinventing TomEE.</p>

     <p>To put simply - JavaEE is a platform.</p>
     <p>It is made up of many specifications which are just APIs. The specific concrete implementations of these APIs are the so called 'Reference Implementation'</p>
     <ol>
      <li>EJB is just one specification within the JavaEE platform</li>
      <li>No, Spring is a application framework that can allow you/has support for you to develop JavaEE applications</li>
     </ol>
     <p>EJB is Enterprise Java Beans</p>

        <td><span>@tair Yes only 1 concrete implementation is regarded as the 'Reference' for e.g. JPA has numerous implementations but only EclipseLink is the RI. When i mentioned RI i was meaning across the different APIs. i think you misunderstood my answer above. Also, yes, Spring integrates with JavaEE which is what i mentioned above.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">SoftwareDeveloper</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">6 Sep 2015 at 20:49</span></td>
