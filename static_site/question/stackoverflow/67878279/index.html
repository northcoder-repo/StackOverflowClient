    <p>I am working on a script to perform an Index/Match task on two seperate workbooks. The code seems to be working but my If statement is always returning its Else condition. I have logged the compared vairables <code>find</code> and <code>searchref</code> and found that they do match at some point durring the loop but the If statement still returns its Else condition.</p>
    <p>I suspect this has something to do with how I am comparing these arrays but I have not been able to figure it out.</p>
    <p>Here is a snip of the first few columns and rows for the source spreadsheet for <code>searchData</code> I am trying to access the information in column B.</p>

     <p>The main problem in the sample code is the <code>else</code> statement containing this:</p>
     <pre><code>found[i] = ['n/a']
</code></pre>
     <p>This will overwrite whatever is found earlier in the loop, because even after a match has been found (and assigned to the <code>found</code> array), the loop continues comparing the remaining values in the inner loop.</p>
     <p>The following approach shows how to correct this, making as few changes as possible to your existing code:</p>
     <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function generateBillOfMaterials() {
  //  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  //  Declare variables
  var i, j
  var find
  var searchref
  //  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  var search_spreadsheet = ... ; 
  var find_spreadsheet = ... ;
  var ssheet = search_spreadsheet.getSheetByName("METAL PARTS");
  var fsheet = find_spreadsheet.getSheetByName("Bill of Materials");
  var FMaxR = fsheet.getMaxRows();
  fsheet.getRange(2, 3, FMaxR, 1).clear({contentsOnly: true});

  var findData = fsheet.getDataRange().getValues();
  var found = new Array(findData.length).fill('n/a'); 
  var searchData = ssheet.getDataRange().getValues();

  for (i = 0; i &lt; findData.length; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j &lt; searchData.length; j++) {

      find = findData[i][1];
      searchref = searchData[j][0];
      if (find === searchref &amp;&amp; find !== "") {
        found[i] = searchData[j][1];
        break; 
      }
    }

  }

  const found2 = found.slice(1).map(x =&gt; [x]);
  fsheet.getRange(2, 3, found.length-1, 1).setValues(found2);
}
</code></pre>
     <p>Notes:</p>
     <p>We pre-fill the array of "found" values with "n/a":</p>
     <pre><code>var found = new Array(findData.length).fill('n/a'); 
</code></pre>
     <p>This allows us to overwrite "n/a" when we find a value - otherwise we leave the "n/a" untouched.</p>
     <p>When a match is found, we break out of the inner loop using <code>break</code>.</p>
     <p>Then we can remove the <code>else</code> condition - as we no longer need it.</p>
     <p>The remaining changes are to ensure the final shape of the <code>found</code> data is a two-dimensional array which can be written to the spreadsheet.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>The above approach involves repeatedly looping over the data in the inner loop.</p>
     <p>In reality, we only need to visit each list once, in order to perform the lookups we need.</p>
     <p>Implementing this alternative approach would basically be a rewrite of what you have - and I would imagine that what you have, even if it is somewhat inefficient, is perfectly OK for your needs. But I did want to mention this.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>The other note which may be of interest is that my alternative approach is more-or-less the equivalent of using a Google Sheets <code>vlookup</code> formula. Apologies if you are already aware of that. And I have never tried using that formula across 2 separate files, anyway. But again, just wanted to mention it, for completeness.</p>
     <hr>
     <p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>
     <p><em>"Is there a lookup command that could be used in place of the for loops?"</em></p>
     <p>It's more a question of avoiding the <em>nested</em> loops, and using a JavaScript data structure that supports lookups (a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Map</code></a>).</p>
     <p>Here is a sketch:</p>
     <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>// assume we have already populated searchData and findData, as usual.

// first iterate searchData to build a lookup map:
let partsLookup = new Map();
for (i = 1; i &lt; searchData.length; i++) {
  partsLookup.set( searchData[i][0], searchData[i][1] );
}

// now iterate the BOM data and use the lookup map:
for (i = 1; i &lt; findData.length; i++) {
  var foundValue = partsLookup.get( findData[i][1] );
  console.log( foundValue ); // add this to the "found" array
}
</code></pre>
     <p>This is obviously not "finished" code - it just shows the approach. But no nested iterations are needed.</p>
     <p>The number of loops performed is <code>searchData.length + findData.length</code>, instead of up to <code>searchData.length * findData.length</code></p>

        <td><span>Thank you! This is working now. I am aware that this is pretty much a <code>vlookup</code> but from what I can tell the<code>vlookup</code> does not work across two different workbooks. I will use this as is for a little while and see how it works. If I find I need more speed I will look into your suggestion. Is there a lookup command that could be used in place of the <code>for</code> loops? I am pretty new to creating these scripts so I am sure there is a lot of functionality I am not aware of.
