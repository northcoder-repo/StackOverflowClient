   <div>
    <p>This is for a Google Sheet which uses GAS but I was advised to try Javascript Tag.</p>
    <p>So I got this script which will read column 1 where I have the dates, and will group all rows by month and within these will group rows by day. This is because within each day I've got a row for every hour or 4 hours or so.</p>
    <p>I need this script to also group by year as well. So it goes like: Year Row -&gt; Month Rows -&gt; Day Rows</p>
    <p>Month and day rows are working. I can't get the year grouping to work. Any ideas where to start?</p>
    <p>The script:</p>
    <pre><code>function groupRow() {

    const timeZone = "GMT+1";
    const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
    const rowStart = 5;
    const rows = sheet.getLastRow() - rowStart + 1;
    const values = sheet.getRange(rowStart, 1, rows, 1).getValues().flat();
    const o = [];

    values.forEach((date, i) =&gt; {
        const [m, d] = Utilities.formatDate(date, timeZone, "yyyyMM,dd").split(",");
        if (!o[m]) {
            o[m] = [];
        }
        if (!o[m][d]) {
            o[m][d] = [];
        }
        o[m][d].push(rowStart + i);
    });

    for (var m in o) {
     o[m] = Object.values(o[m]).sort((a,b) =&gt; parseInt(a) - parseInt(b));
    }

    Object.values(o).forEach(m =&gt; {
        for (const d of m) {
            if (d.length === 1) {
            continue;
            }
            const range = `${ d[1] }:${ d.slice(-1)[0] }`;
            sheet.getRange(range).shiftRowGroupDepth(1);
        }
        const a = m.flat();
        if (a.length === 1) {
            return;
        }
        const range = `${ a[1] }:${ a.slice(-1)[0] }`;
        sheet.getRange(range).shiftRowGroupDepth(1);
    });
}

     <p>Well, it's me again. :) I can't sleep whenever there is some unsolved code.</p>
     <p>It seems work to a degree:</p>
     <pre><code>function groupRow() {

  var timeZone = "GMT+1";
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
  var rowStart = 5;

  var o = {};

  // make the object {'year': { 'month':[days] } }
  values.forEach((date, i) =&gt; {
      var [y, m, d] = Utilities.formatDate(date, timeZone, "yyyy,MM,dd").split(",");
      // console.log(y, m, d);
      if (!o[y]) o[y] = {};
      if (!o[y][m]) o[y][m] = {};
      if (!o[y][m][d]) o[y][m][d] = [];
      o[y][m][d].push(rowStart + i);
  });
  
  // convert the unordered object {year:{month:[days]}}
  // into the ordered 3d-array [year[month[days]]]
  const numsort = (a,b) =&gt; parseInt(a) - parseInt(b);
  var years = Object.keys(o).sort(numsort)
    .map(y =&gt; Object.keys(o[y]).sort(numsort)
    .map(m =&gt; Object.values(o[y][m]).sort(numsort)));
  
  // group rows by years
  years.forEach(y =&gt; shift_rows(y.map(m =&gt; m.flat()).flat(),sheet));

  // group rows by months
  years.flat().forEach(m =&gt; shift_rows(m.flat(),sheet));

  // group rows by days
  years.flat().flat().forEach(d =&gt; shift_rows(d.flat(),sheet));

  function shift_rows(rows,sheet) {
    if (rows.length === 1) return;
    var range = `${ rows[1] }:${ rows.slice(-1) }`;
    sheet.getRange(range).shiftRowGroupDepth(1);

     <p>But the code is really complicated already. It's need to test and... most likely, to rewrite it from scratch.</p>

Technically to use 'const' and 'let' is a better style. I rewrote a part of the code because I failed to add the new functionality via little changes. Sometimes it can be fixed, sometimes it's easier to rebuilt. As for my remark about 'it's need to rewrite' -- I still have the vague felling that the algorithm is wrong and slow.

This time I will try to make this script not to duplicate row groups because what I am trying to do is: I've got another script which records new rows to the LOG every hour or 10 mins wtv. The purpose of the grouping function is to group everything when it runs the first time. When it runs next, if the rows are already grouped, this script would just group the newer ungrouped rows and either add them to the previous rows if belonging to the day or create new group and add the new one and the next ones to this new group.

     <p>This approach to handling row groups tries to focus on readability/maintainability over efficiency, by minimizing array manipulation. If the code runs too slowly, then you can consider performance optimizations - but those can generally make the code harder to read.</p>
     <p>It also tries to make the code easier to test by breaking it down into multiple separate functions, where each function tries to do as little logic as possible (I'm sure that could be improved &amp; simplified, even further).</p>
     <p>It makes 3 passes over the dates data, one for each type of grouping (year, month, and date). That's the big compromise vs. efficiency.</p>
     <p>I've presented it here as a runnable snippet with some hard-coded data, not as a full GAS script, since the core of the logic is pure JavaScript.</p>

        <td><span>Thank you Andrew. So according to your instructions at the bottom of the snippet I tried to define the rangeStart and rangeEnd values like so: <code>var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();</code> <code>var rangeEnd = sheet.getLastRow() - rowStart + 1;</code> <code>var rangeStart = sheet.getRange(rowStart, 1, rangeEnd, 1).getValues().flat();</code> Also the grouping function should be: <code>rangeGroup.shiftRowGroupDepth(1);</code> ?</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Verminous</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">1 Sep 2021 at 19:10</span></td>

        <td></td>
        <td><span>I get a <i><code>TypeError: rangeStart.forEach is not a function</code></i> error</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Verminous</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">1 Sep 2021 at 19:20</span></td>

       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td><span>It works. I was thinking of a way not to duplicate rows and just group the new ones when it is executed again. I thought it could be a good idea to define the <code>rowStart</code>variable as the last row like <code>getLastRow()+1</code>or something. That way the function <code>groupingDemo()</code>would execute again but just for the new created rows. It does this but for example it does not recognize the Year group previously created on the 1st execution, so it does not join the new rows to that group neither does it do it for month and day groups created previously. It creates new group for the same year etc.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Verminous</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">1 Sep 2021 at 21:57</span></td>

       <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td><span>You want to merge newly added rows into existing groups? I don't think Sheets supports doing that... I think you have to delete groups and re-build. Which means you would probably have to delete &amp; rebuild all the groups for the current year, at the very least. I don't see any way to add to a group manually by editing the sheet, or programmatically. But I could be wrong.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">andrewJames</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">1 Sep 2021 at 23:11</span></td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td><span>Maybe there is another way instead of merging groups: I can have 3 separate scripts or functions: 1st for day groups, 2nd for month groups and 3rd for year groups. Maybe I can compare last row with 2nd last row and determine if day changed. If yes just run the 1st script for day groups. If month changed run 2nd script for month which groups by day and month. If year changed run 3rd script which groups by day, month and year. I need to test if running the previous version which had no year group, works on a set of rows with a year group and so on.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Verminous</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">2 Sep 2021 at 00:46</span></td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td><span>Actually I just realized that that won't work. This is because the variable <code>rowStart</code> will make it so that everything gets grouped again from the 5th row downwards. So I guess the solution here is to make the <code>rowStart</code> to advance as rows are getting grouped. So this variable cannot remain fixed at the 5th row. It must be equal to the last grouped row +1. Now there must be a way to get which row was grouped last. And it needs to be a way that identifies the last row grouped by day, the last grouped by month and the last grouped by year and if none then = 5.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Verminous</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">5 Sep 2021 at 20:43</span></td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td><span>It works if I do : <code>rowStart = sheet.getLastRow() - 24;</code> this is because I use an hourly time trigger to execute the script. So the logger script adds 1 row every hour. So I get last row, subtract 24 rows (1 row per hour) and the script will only group rows from the resulting row forward. Problem is google triggers sometimes return errors and it might happen that sometimes I dont get exactly 24 rows but less. Also happens lately I get about 4 triggers in a row in a minute in my main file where I have 10min trigger. Also if I use this for month group, months have 28, 30, 31 days. It's a problem</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Verminous</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">5 Sep 2021 at 22:10</span></td>
