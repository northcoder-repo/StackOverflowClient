    <p>I am trying to create a java to check strength of a password with regex. The password must pass 3 out of 4 conditions:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>lowercase</li>
     <li>uppercase</li>
     <li>contains digits</li>
     <li>has special characters</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The code looks like below:</p>
    <pre><code>import java.util.*;

public class StringPasswordStrength {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter password: ");
        String password = input.nextLine();
        boolean test = checkStrength(password);
        if (test) {
            System.out.print("OK");
        }
        else {
            System.out.print("Not strong enough!");
        }       
    }
    public static boolean checkStrength(String password) {
        if (password.matches("^(?=.*[a-zA-Z][0-9][!@#$%^&amp;*])(?=.{8,})")){
            return true;
        }
        else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>However when the password is <code>Passw0rd</code> it doesn't accept. How can I change the conditions in regex that the program would accept <code>Passw0rd</code> because it passes 3 out of 4 conditions: uppercase, lowercase and digit?</p>

     <p>I would suggest <strong><em>avoiding a potentially cryptic regular expression</em></strong> for this, and instead to provide something easier to read, understand and maintain (albeit more verbose).</p>
     <p>Something like this (depending on what your conditions are, of course). For example, a length test should be mandatory:</p>
     <pre><code>public boolean isValid(String password) {
    // password must contain 3 out of 4 of lowercase, uppercase, digits,
    // and others (punctuation, symbols, spaces, etc.).
    if (password == null) {
        return false;
    }

    if (password.length() &lt; 8) {
        return false;
    }

    char[] chars = password.toCharArray();
    int lowers = 0;
    int uppers = 0;
    int digits = 0;
    int others = 0;
    for (Character c : chars) {
        if (Character.isLowerCase(c)) {
            lowers = 1;
        } else if (Character.isUpperCase(c)) {
            uppers = 1;
        } else if (Character.isDigit(c)) {
            digits = 1;
        } else {
            others = 1;
        }
    }
    // at least 3 out of 4 tests must pass:
    return (lowers + uppers + digits + others &gt;= 3);
}
</code></pre>
     <p>I understand this is not a direct answer to your question, and so may not meet your needs.</p>
     <p>I am also deliberately avoiding the discussion about <code>char[]</code> vs. <code>String</code> for password handling in Java - for example, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8881291/why-is-char-preferred-over-string-for-passwords">see this post</a>.</p>
     <p>EDIT: Removed wording relating to password length, and changed related code to reflect the question.</p>

You're right, add a 15 char limit theory on top of the "change every 30 days to refresh the DB incase a leak occurred", passwords become a burden, giving higher risk of users to use incremental passwords (MyPassword1, MyPassword2, etc..). This would be a problem if a DB were to leak, as passwords would become more easily guessed if an old password was rainbow-tabled. If I were putting a password on a computer with no network card, just to avoid my kids from accessing, I would not use a 15 character password, that's for sure.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Dioxin</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">28 Feb 2020 at 03:14</span></td>

     <p>Your issue has been pointed out by another user, along with a solution. This is an alternative solution.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>Have 4 <code>Pattern</code> objects, one for each requirement</p>
     <pre><code>Pattern uppercase = Pattern.compile("[A-Z]");
Pattern number = Pattern.compile("\\d+");
Pattern symbol = Pattern.compile("[+&amp;$%!@]");
Pattern other = ...;

     <p><sup><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#matches-java.lang.String-" rel="nofollow noreferrer">String#matches</a> "compiles" the regex every time it is called, which can be time consuming. By using <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pattern</a> objects, you'll be using already-compiled regex patterns.</sup></p>
     <p>Add the requirements to a list</p>
     <pre><code>List&lt;Pattern&gt; requirements = Arrays.asList(uppercase, number, symbol, other);
</code></pre>
     <p>Loop over the list of requirements. For each requirement, check if the password matches the requirement. If the element does, increase a counter which tracks how many requirements have already been met.</p>
     <p>If the requirements equals 3 (or is greater than 3), return <code>true</code>. If the loop exits gracefully, that means 3 requirements were not met; return <code>false</code> if the loop exits gracefully.</p>

     <p>I assume the four requirements, of which at three must be met, are as follows. The string must contain:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>a letter</li>
      <li>a digit</li>
      <li>a character in the string "!@#$%^&amp;*"</li>
      <li>at least 8 characters</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Is the use of a regular expression the best way to determine if a password meets three of the four requirements? That may be a valid question but it's not the one being asked or the one that I will attempt to answer. The OP may just be curious: can this problem be solved using a regular expression? Moreover, even if there are better ways to address the problem there is educational value in answers to the specific question that's been posed.</p>
     <p>I am not familiar with Java, but I can suggest a regular expression that uses Ruby syntax. Readers unfamiliar with Ruby should be able to understand the expression, and its translation to Java should be straightforward. (If a reader can perform that translation, I would be grateful to see an edit to this answer that provides the Java equivalent at the end.)</p>
     <pre><code>r = /
    ((?=.*[a-z]))      # match a lowercase letter in the string in
                       # a positive lookahead in cap grp 1, 0 times
    ((?=.*\d))         # match a digit in the string in a positive
                       # lookahead in cap grp 2, 0 times
    ((?=.*[!@#$%^&amp;*])) # match a special character in in the string
                       # in a positive lookahead in cap grp 3, 0 times
    (.{8,})            # match at least 8 characters in cap grp 4, 0 times
    \g&lt;1&gt;\g&lt;2&gt;\g&lt;3&gt;    # match conditions 1, 2 and 3
    |                  # or
    \g&lt;1&gt;\g&lt;2&gt;\g&lt;4&gt;    # match conditions 1, 2 and 4
    |                  # or
    \g&lt;1&gt;\g&lt;3&gt;\g&lt;4&gt;    # match conditions 1, 3 and 4
    |                  # or
    \g&lt;2&gt;\g&lt;3&gt;\g&lt;4&gt;    # match conditions 2, 3 and 4
    /xi                # case indiff &amp; free-spacing regex def modes 
</code></pre>
     <p><code>\g{2}</code>, for example, is replaced by the <em>sub-expression</em> contained in capture group 2 (<code>(?=.*\d)</code>). The first four lines each contain an expression in a capture group, with the capture group repeated zero times. This is just a device to define the subexpressions in the capture groups for retrieval later.</p>
     <p>Let's test some strings.</p>
     <pre><code>"Passw0rd".match? r  #=&gt; true  (a letter, digit and &gt;= 8)
"ab2c#45d".match? r  #=&gt; true  (all 4 conditions satisfied)
"ab2c#5d".match?  r  #=&gt; true  (a letter, digit and special char)
"ab2c345d".match? r  #=&gt; true  (a letter, digit and &gt;= 8)
"ab#c?def".match? r  #=&gt; true  (a letter, special char and &gt;= 8)
"21#6?512".match? r  #=&gt; true  (a digit, special char and &gt;= 8)

"ab26c4".match?   r  #=&gt; false (only letter and digit)
"a$b#c".match?    r  #=&gt; false (only letter and special char)
"abc ef h".match? r  #=&gt; false (only letter and &gt;= 8)
"12 45 78".match? r  #=&gt; false (only digit and &gt;=8)
"########".match? r  #=&gt; false (only special char and &gt;= 8)
"".match          r  #=&gt; false (no condition matched) 
</code></pre>
     <p>To use named capture groups, <code>((?=.*[a-z]))</code> would be replaced with, say,</p>
     <pre><code>(?&lt;letter&gt;(?=.*[a-z]))
</code></pre>
     <p>and <code>\g&lt;1&gt;\g&lt;2&gt;\g&lt;3&gt;</code> would be replaced by something like</p>
     <pre><code>\g&lt;letter&gt;\g&lt;digit&gt;\g&lt;spec_char&gt;

     <p>To answer your question, the sequence in which you have provided</p>
     <p>1st: <code>[a-zA-Z]</code> characters</p>
     <p>2nd: <code>[0-9]</code> Numbers</p>
     <p>3rd: <code>[!@#$%^&amp;*]</code> Sp. Chars</p>
     <p>The occurrence of literals in this sequence is must. <code>Abcd1234@</code> will pass but <code>Abcd1234@A</code> will not pass, as <code>A</code> appears again after <code>[!@#$%^&amp;*]</code></p>
     <p>And a positive lookahead must include this sequence only. If you provied any special char before, it will not be validated, similarly in your case, characters after number is not expected.</p>
     <p>use a positive lookahead for each combination, use groups for each</p>
     <p>Try this instead(This is my work after several lookups):</p>
     <pre><code>^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[!@#$%&amp;*_])(?!.*[`~^=+/?&lt;&gt;():;-])(?=\S+$).{8,20}$
</code></pre>
     <p>In this case: any of the provided chars or literals can appear anywhere.</p>
     <pre><code>(?=.*[0-9])

(?=.*[a-z])

(?=.*[A-Z])

(?=.*[!@#$%&amp;*_])

Why not have 3 <code>matches</code> calls, using pre-compiled <code>Pattern</code> objects? It would look a lot cleaner at the cost of minimal performance overhead (if any overhead, considering he's currently not using a pre-compiled pattern). That way, you can remove the semantics of relativity (look-aheads and such), semantics which should not exist for a problem where relativity doesn't matter.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Dioxin</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">28 Feb 2020 at 02:38</span></td>
