     <p><code>+</code> means a space <em>only</em> in <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> content, such as the query part of a URL:</p>
     <pre><code>http://www.example.com/path/foo+bar/path?query+name=query+value
</code></pre>
     <p>In this URL, the parameter name is <code>query name</code> with a space and the value is <code>query value</code> with a space, but the folder name in the path is literally <code>foo+bar</code>, <em>not</em> <code>foo bar</code>.</p>
     <p><code>%20</code> is a valid way to encode a space in either of these contexts. So if you need to URL-encode a string for inclusion in part of a URL, it is always safe to replace spaces with <code>%20</code> and pluses with <code>%2B</code>. This is what, e.g., <code>encodeURIComponent()</code> does in JavaScript. Unfortunately it's not what <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.urlencode.php" rel="noreferrer">urlencode</a> does in PHP (<a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.rawurlencode.php" rel="noreferrer">rawurlencode</a> is safer).</p>

     <p>So, the answers here are all a bit incomplete. The use of a '%20' to encode a space in URLs is explicitly defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986" rel="noreferrer">RFC&nbsp;3986</a>, which defines how a URI is built. There is no mention in this specification of using a '+' for encoding spaces - if you go solely by this specification, a space must be encoded as '%20'.</p>
     <p>The mention of using '+' for encoding spaces comes from the various incarnations of the HTML specification - specifically in the section describing content type 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'. This is used for posting form data.</p>
     <p>Now, the HTML 2.0 <em>specification</em> <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1866" rel="noreferrer">(RFC 1866)</a> explicitly said, in section 8.2.2, that the <em>query</em> part of a GET request's URL string should be encoded as 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'. This, in theory, suggests that it's legal to use a '+' in the URL in the query string (after the '?').</p>
     <p>But... does it really? Remember, HTML is itself a content specification, and URLs with query strings can be used with content other than HTML. Further, while the later versions of the HTML spec continue to define '+' as legal in 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' content, they completely omit the part saying that GET request query strings are defined as that type. There is, in fact, no mention whatsoever about the query string encoding in anything after the HTML 2.0 specification.</p>
     <p>Which leaves us with the question - is it valid? Certainly there's a <em>lot</em> of legacy code which supports '+' in query strings, and a lot of code which generates it as well. So odds are good you won't break if you use '+'. (And, in fact, I did all the research on this recently because I discovered a major site which failed to accept '%20' in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods" rel="noreferrer">GET</a> query as a space. They actually failed to decode <em>any</em> percent encoded character. So the service you're using may be relevant as well.)</p>
     <p>But from a pure reading of the specifications, without the language from the HTML 2.0 specification carried over into later versions, URLs are covered entirely by RFC&nbsp;3986, which means spaces ought to be converted to '%20'. And definitely that should be the case if you are requesting anything other than an HTML document.</p>

     <p>The part before the question mark must use % encoding (so <code>%20</code> for space), after the question mark you can use either <code>%20</code> or <code>+</code> for a space. If you need an actual <code>+</code> after the question mark use <code>%2B</code>.</p>

     <p>For compatibility reasons, it's better to always encode spaces as "%20", not as "+".</p>
     <p>It was <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1866" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RFC 1866</a> (HTML 2.0 specification), which specified that space characters should be encoded as "+" in "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" content-type key-value pairs. (see paragraph 8.2.1. subparagraph 1.). This way of encoding form data is also given in later HTML specifications, look for relevant paragraphs about application/x-www-form-urlencoded.</p>
     <p>Here is an example of a URL string where RFC&nbsp;1866 allows encoding spaces as pluses: "http://example.com/over/there?name=foo+bar". So, only after "?", spaces can be replaced by pluses, according to RFC&nbsp;1866. In other cases, spaces should be encoded to %20. But since it's hard to determine the context, it's the best practice to never encode spaces as "+".</p>
     <p>I would recommend to percent-encode all characters except "unreserved" defined in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#Refinement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RFC&nbsp;3986</a>, p.2.3.</p>
     <pre><code>unreserved = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
</code></pre>
     <p>The only situation when you may want to encode spaces as "+" (one byte) rather than "%20" (three bytes) is when you know for sure how to interpret the context, and when the size of the query string is of the essence.</p>

     <p>What's the difference? See the other answers.</p>
     <p>When should we use <code>+</code> instead of <code>%20</code>? Use <code>+</code> if, for some reason, you want to make the URL query string (<code>?.....</code>) or hash fragment (<code>#....</code>) more readable. Example: You can actually read this:</p>
     <p><a href="https://www.google.se/#q=google+doesn%27t+encode+:+and+uses+%2B+instead+of+spaces" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.google.se/#q=google+doesn%27t+encode+:+and+uses+%2B+instead+of+spaces</a> (<code>%2B</code> = +)</p>
     <p>But the following is a lot harder to read (at least to me):</p>
     <p><a href="https://www.google.se/#q=google%20doesn%27t%20oops%20:%20%20this%20text%20%2B%20is%20different%20spaces" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.google.se/#q=google%20doesn%27t%20oops%20:%20%20this%20text%20%2B%20is%20different%20spaces</a></p>
     <p>I would think <code>+</code> is unlikely to break anything, since Google uses <code>+</code> (see the 1st link above) and they've probably thought about this. I'm going to use <code>+</code> myself just because readable + Google thinks it's OK.</p>

        <td><span>@FlipMcF Citing google's behavior, in this case, is a valid argument to using "+" in URLs. It's not that google is an authority, but that google is probably the biggest internet company and if they do something in some way, it is highly unlikely that browsers will one day decide to stop supporting that practice. Also, google chrome is one of the browsers with highest share, and they will support whatever google wants to. All in all, I'd say that no one using "+" instead of "%20" will have a hard time because of that in the foreseeable future.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">jdferreira</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">13 May 2017 at 10:29</span></td>

They can have a URL like <code>google.se/?your?query?here</code> and it would be invalid, but what do they care as long as their servers interpret it correctly and return your search results? It would be more interesting to see how they encode outgoing requests (like in fetching RSS), but even then, it's not a valid argument. Google is huge: no way that the url experts look at every place url encoding is used.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Luc</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">5 Sep 2019 at 09:02</span></td>

Meaning, Google likely does things correctly, follows the standards. — Google wants to be easy to link to? Doesn't want to make other external software confused &amp; with broken links to Google's search results, because then Google would get a bit less traffic, and Bing etc would have a small advantage, in being better to link to.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">KajMagnus</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">5 Sep 2019 at 20:29</span></td>
