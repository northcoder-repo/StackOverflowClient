     <p>Although not everything in Java is supported under GCJ, especially the GUI components (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161020222532im_/https://gcc.gnu.org/java/faq.html#2_1" rel="noreferrer">What Java API's are supported?

I haven't used GCJ much, but from the limited testing I've done with console applications, it seems fine.</p>
     <p>One downside of using GCJ to create an standalone executable is that the size of the resulting EXE can be quite large. One time I compiled a trivial console application in GCJ and the result was an executable about 1 MB. (There may be ways around this that I am not aware of. Another option would be executable compression programs.)</p>
     <p>In terms of open-source installers, the <a href="https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page" rel="noreferrer">Nullsoft Scriptable Install System</a> is a scriptable installer. If you're curious, there are <a href="https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Category:Code_Examples" rel="noreferrer">user contributed examples</a> on how to detect the presence of a JRE and install it automatically if the required JRE is not installed. (Just to let you know, I haven't used NSIS before.)</p>

     <p>We're using <a href="http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Install4J</a> to build installers for Windows or Unix environments.</p>
     <p>It's easily customizable up to the point where you want to write scripts for special actions that cannot be done with standard dialogues. But even though we're setting up Windows services with it, we're only using standard components.</p>
     <ul>
      <li>installer + launcher</li>
      <li>Windows or Unix</li>
      <li>scriptable in Java</li>

     <p>I think Launch4J is from the same company (just the launcher - no installer).</p>

     <p>I would say launch4j is the best tool for converting a java source code(.java) to .exe file You can even bundle a jre with it for distribution and the exe can even be iconified. Although the size of application increases, it makes sure that the application will work perfectly even if the user does not have a jre installed. It also makes sure that you are able to provide the specific jre required for your app without the user having to install it separately. But unfortunately, java loses its importance. Its multi platform support is totally ignored and the final app is only supported for windows. But that is not a big deal, if you are catering only to windows users.</p>

     <p>As of JDK14, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/jpackage/packaging-overview.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jpackage</a> replaces <code>javapackager</code> mentioned in @Jay answer. The Windows version requires Wix 3.0 and it is fairly straightforward to take a java application and build an installer which provides EXE launcher.</p>
     <p>It can also be used with <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/specs/man/jlink.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jlink</a> to build a cut-down Java runtime image which is bundled with the installer and only contains the set of modules needed to support your application. The <code>jlink</code> step will also be run implicitly by jpackage if no runtime is specified, but I prefer to make the JRE image separately as it will only change when you update JDK or add new module dependencies to your project.</p>
     <p>Example main for Java class:</p>
     <pre><code>package exe;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; args.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("args["+i+"]="+args[i]);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
     <p>Here are example steps to build on Windows - obviously you'd set up your local build environment (Maven / ant / etc) to re-produce this:</p>
     <pre><code>mkdir jpackage.input\jars tmp
javac -d tmp src\exe\Main.java
pushd tmp &amp;&amp; jar cvf ..\jpackage.input\jars\myapp.jar . &amp;&amp; popd
</code></pre>
     <p>Check it runs:</p>
     <pre><code>java -cp jpackage.input\jars\myapp.jar exe.Main X Y Z
</code></pre>
     <p>Create a runtime image with jlink for the set of modules use by your application:</p>
     <pre><code>set jlink.modules=java.base
jlink --add-modules %jlink.modules% --strip-debug --no-man-pages --no-header-files --compress=1 --output jpackage.jre
</code></pre>
     <p>In case there are missing modules above, you should check the jlink JRE runtime image can run your app:</p>
     <pre><code>jpackage.jre\bin\java -cp jpackage.input\jars\myapp.jar exe.Main X Y Z
</code></pre>
     <p>Use jpackage to generate installer, with app <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62675323/cannot-rerun-java-jpackage-installer-if-already-installed-second-time-just-exit/62819060#62819060">version</a> based on date+hour (this saves on need to un-install every re-install) and to print out all system properties - remove the parameter "-XshowSettings:properties" after testing:</p>
     <pre><code>set appver=%date:~6,2%.%date:~3,2%.%date:~0,2%%time:~0,2%
jpackage --win-console --input jpackage.input --runtime-image jpackage.jre --app-version %appver% --type exe --name "MyApp" --dest jpackage.dest --java-options "-XshowSettings:properties" --main-jar jars\myapp.jar --main-class exe.Main
</code></pre>
     <p>Run the installer:</p>
     <pre><code>jpackage.dest\MyApp-%appver%.exe
</code></pre>
     <p>Test the application:</p>
     <pre><code>"C:\Program Files\MyApp\MyApp.exe" ONE 2 THREE

... Prints system properties ...

args[0]=ONE
args[1]=2
args[2]=THREE
</code></pre>

     <p>Alternatively, you can use some java-to-c translator (e.g., <a href="http://www.ivmaisoft.com/jcgo/" rel="noreferrer">JCGO</a>) and compile the generated C files to a native binary (.exe) file for the target platform.</p>

     <p>I can be forgiven for being against converting a java program to a .exe Application and I have My reasons. the Major one being that a java program can be compiled to a jar file from A lot of IDE's. When the program is in .jar format, it can run in Multiple Platforms as opposed to .exe which would run Only in very limited Environment. I am for the Idea that Java Programs shoudl not be converted to Exe unless it is very neccesary. One can always write .bat files that runs the Java program while it is a jar file.</p>
     <p>if it is really neccesary to convert it to exe, Jar2Exe converter silently does that and one can also attach Libraries that are compiled together with the Main Application.</p>

Instead it is better to wrap it in all possible formats for all systems instead of limiting the user to .exe for example, and providing them on the product's website or any other way of distribution.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Skaldebane</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">2 May 2021 at 22:35</span></td>

     <p>You can convert jar to exe using <a href="http://www.regexlab.com/en/jar2exe/" rel="nofollow">jar2exe</a>. However you need to purchase the software. If you need a open source software i would suggest <a href="http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">JSmooth</a>.</p>

     <p><em>Cautionary note:</em> Much has changed with packaging and deployment since this question was first asked. Most of the answers given are not even current with JIGSAW (Java 9+).</p>
     <p>If the goal is to create OS specific packages, information is provided in Oracle Docs Java 17 <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/7/jpackage/packaging-overview.html#GUID-C1027043-587D-418D-8188-EF8F44A4C06A" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Packaging Tool User Guide</a>. This guide includes documentation for the <code>jpackage</code> tool, which allows one to create platform-specific packages for Linux, macOS and Windows. I assume the Windows-specific instructions should include arriving at an .exe file, since that remains the most familiar way for Windows users to install and run applications.</p>
     <p>My own personal experience creating an exe (for sale on itch.io) was with the <em>Java Platform, Standard Edition Deployment Guide</em>, which included making use of the tool <em>Inno Setup 5</em>. This documentation is older, is for Java 9. The section directly pertaining to .exe packaging is located <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/deploy/self-contained-application-packaging.htm#JSDPG600" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> As a first step, I used <code>jlink</code> to make a self-contained package. At the time I was first wrangling with this, I was unable to figure out how to get <code>jpackage</code> to work with my modular program. But now that Jigsaw has been around for several years, <code>jpackage</code> is now likely much easier to use, and would be my first choice for the next Java app I might publish for Windows users.</p>

The closest you can get is using <code>jpackage</code> with the <code>appimage</code> format/output. This will give you a folder with an actually .exe. But other assets are in the folder beside the .exe. Actually smooshing all the files/folders into one single .exe..

     <p>Java projects are exported as Jar executables. When you wanna do a .exe file of a java project, what you can do is 'convert' the JAR to EXE (i remark that i putted between quotes convert because isn't exactly this).</p>
     <p>From intelij you gonna be able to generate only the jar</p>
     <p>Try following the next example : <a href="https://www.genuinecoder.com/convert-java-jar-to-exe/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.genuinecoder.com/convert-java-jar-to-exe/</a></p>
