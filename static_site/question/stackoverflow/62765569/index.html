   <div>
    <p>Well, wondering what is the suggested way (i.e. best practice) to pass some dictionary to function/method, modify it and "return" to the user?</p>
    <p>For example, as dictionary is mutable, we can simply do:</p>
    <pre><code>my_dict = {
    'a': 'b'
}

def foo(bar):
    # Do something with `bar`...
    ...
    bar['c'] = d  # Update `bar`.

foo(my_dict)
# Do something with modified `my_dict`...
</code></pre>
    <p>This is what I was doing mostly in the past.</p>
    <p>But another, more explicit, way to get the same effect would be:</p>
    <pre><code>my_dict = {
    'a': 'b'
}

def foo(bar):
    # Do something with `bar`...
    ...
    bar['c'] = 'd'  # Update `bar`.
    return bar

my_dict = foo(my_dict)
# Do something with modified `my_dict`...
</code></pre>
    <p>This maybe follows better one of the most important Python principles: "<em>Explicit is better than implicit.</em>", but definitely requires little more writing (maybe unnecessarily).</p>
    <p>Of course, there are also other approaches to achieve the same, but wondering which is preferred way between above two?</p>
    <p>P.S. This is my first question ever on StackOverflow (for 10+ years in programming)... I tried to search for similar use-cases (as always), but incredible that nobody ever asked.</p>
    <p><em>EDIT: Updated examples to be more specific.</em></p>

       <td><span>Generally, it is considered <i>bad practice</i> for a function to mutate its inputs to begin with. But given that, it is actually returning <code>None</code> that is considered idiomatic and more explicit. When you return the object, it is unclear if it is a new object or the same object that was passed in. In Python, it would be assumed that it is not the same object, and would be surprising if the object being passed in were mutated.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">juanpa.arrivillaga</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">6 Jul 2020 at 22:45</span></td>

       <td><span>@juanpa.arrivillaga Got it, and makes sense. However, if that's well-known antipattern (or <i>bad practice</i> by some other opinions), what would be proper way to achieve the same in Python? Of course, we can always create new instance based on the original one, modify it as we want and return that one as a result (like already proposed in one of the answers)... But here we could possible have other penalties (performance, memory) when manipulating with large objects.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Wolf</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">8 Jul 2020 at 11:36</span></td>

     <p>I'd say better to not return</p>
     <p>Well look no further than <code>list.sort()</code></p>
     <p>It sorts list in-place, meaning original list changes, and <strong>nothing</strong> is returned.</p>
     <p>The reason for returning <code>None</code> is so users do not get confused (thinking original list is preserved)</p>
     <p>The most important thing is to properly name what you're doing<br>
       e.g.</p>
     <pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def fill_with_defaults(cfg):
    ...
</code></pre>
     <p>And then <code>fill_with_defaults(configuration)</code> is looking perfectly readable</p>
     <p>And as for "explicit", no return value is even better because the reader knows something is changed in-place<br>
       meaning he wouldn't consider <code>config2 = fill_with_defaults(configuration)</code><br>
       leading to buggy code (cuz changing one config affects other)</p>

     <p>If you're not using the keys or values in <code>bar</code> why is it necessary to pass it in:</p>
     <pre><code>my_dict = {

     <p>I would do:</p>
     <pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>my_dict = {
    'a': 'b'

def foo(bar):
    return dict(bar, **{'c':'d'})

my_dict = foo(my_dict)

     <p>It's essentially merge <code>bar</code> with whatever the other <code>dict</code> is, taking the latest key-value in case of conflict.</p>
     <p>Not sure if it's canonical or most pythonish, however it's pretty clean way of doing what you're trying to do...</p>
