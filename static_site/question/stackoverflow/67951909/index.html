   <div>
    <p>I need some help with creating a function for a trigger in google sheets. The scenario is that I have a checkbox on C15 and D15. The idea is to have the checkbox be unchecked by itself after 7days of checking it off. For example, If I were to check the box on a specific time, I would like to have the box be unchecked 7days on that specific time.</p>
    <p>I'm having the issue of figuring out how to make a function to activate a trigger based on editing the cell. I currently use a week time based trigger that looks like this for other checkboxes but it's based on week timer and not on a onEdit.</p>
    <pre><code> function WeeklyReset(){
  var ws = SpreadsheetApp.openById("Sheet");
  var tArray = ["C15:D15","C18:D21","C24:D25"];
  var d = new Date();
  var hr = d.getHours();
  var day = d.getDay();
  var min = d.getMinutes(); 

  if (hr == 5 &amp;&amp; day == 1){
       for (tr of tArray){
      var tRange = ws.getRange(tr);
    tRange.setValue(false);
  }
 }
 }
</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Updated Code Credit to AndrewJames for helping build the code</strong></p>
    <pre><code>function onEdit(e) {
 // resets the cell note's timestamp - but only if the cell's
 // checkbox was changed to "selected" (value of TRUE):
 var range = e.range;
 var rangeA1 = range.getA1Notation(); 
 var sheetName = e.range.getSheet().getName();
 if (sheetName === "Sheet Id" &amp;&amp; rangeA1 === "C15" &amp;&amp; range.getValue()) {
var date = new Date();
 // date.getTime() is a value in milliseconds:
range.setNote('Checked:' + date.getTime() + ':' + date);
}
}

function resetCheckbox() {
// resets the checkbox from "selected" to "unselected", if it has been 
// selected for longer than the required period of time. This is 
// run by a time-based trigger (e.g. once per minute):
var mySheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName("Sheet Id");
var range = mySheet.getRange("C15");
var note = range.getNote().split(':');
if (range.getValue() &amp;&amp; note.length &gt; 1) {
      var lastChecked = note[1];
      var now = new Date().getTime(); // milliseconds
  if (now - lastChecked &gt; 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) { // 7 days  ...
}
}
}
</code></pre>
    <p>I've also set up a trigger to run function resetCheckbox On a time-driven event with a time based trigger on mintue timer and interval or every minute.</p>

     <p>Here are 2 functions which can help, when used together.</p>
     <p><strong>Capture Checked Timestamp</strong></p>
     <p>This captures the time in milliseconds when the checkbox was most recently checked. The timestamp is stored as a cell note, along with a human-readable version of the timestamp (but you could store it <a href="https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/metadata" rel="nofollow noreferrer">elsewhere</a>, if you prefer).</p>
     <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function onEdit(e) {
  // resets the cell note's timestamp - but only if the cell's
  // checkbox was changed to "selected" (value of TRUE):
  var range = e.range;
  var rangeA1 = range.getA1Notation(); 
  var sheetName = e.range.getSheet().getName();
  if (sheetName === 'YOUR SHEET NAME HERE' &amp;&amp; rangeA1 === 'B14' &amp;&amp; range.getValue()) {
    var date = new Date();
    // date.getTime() is a value in milliseconds:
    range.setNote('Checked:' + date.getTime() + ':' + date);
  }
}
</code></pre>
     <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> This function runs whenever a user makes an edit, but only acts if the specific cell is edited (B14 in this case). It does not fire when another script or a formula changes a value.</p>
     <p>(Credit to @cooper for the correction.)</p>
     <p><strong>Expiration Checker</strong></p>
     <p>This function checks if the most recent timestamp is older than the expiry threshold. If it is, then the checkbox is unset:</p>
     <pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function resetCheckbox() {
  // resets the checkbox from "selected" to "unselected", if it has been 
  // selected for longer than the required period of time. This is 
  // run by a time-based trigger (e.g. once per minute):
  var mySheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName("YOUR SHEET NAME HERE");
  var range = mySheet.getRange('B14');
  var note = range.getNote().split(':');
  if (range.getValue() &amp;&amp; note.length &gt; 1) {
    var lastChecked = note[1];
    var now = new Date().getTime(); // milliseconds
    if (now - lastChecked &gt; 5 * 60 * 1000) { // 5 minutes
      range.uncheck();
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
     <p>This function needs to be attached to a time-based trigger - for example, one which runs once every minute.</p>
     <p>In my example, for testing, I set the threshold to 5 minutes.</p>
     <p>Remember to replace <code>YOUR SHEET NAME HERE</code> in both functions.</p>
     <hr>
     <p><strong>Update</strong></p>
     <p>How I created my trigger:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>From the code page, hover over the alarm clock icon and click on "triggers".</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Choose <code>resetCheckbox</code> as the function to run.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Choose <code>Time-driven</code> as the event source.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Choose <code>Minutes timer</code> as the trigger type.</p></li>
      <li>
       <p>Choose <code>Every minute</code> as the interval.</p></li>
     </ol>
     <p>"<em>there isn't a trigger for 7 days</em>" - that is not relevant here.</p>
     <p>You don't want to run your trigger once every 7 days. You want the trigger to run <em>far more frequently than that</em>. Once a minute is good - or once an hour, perhaps.</p>
     <p>You want the <code>now - lastChecked</code> value to be longer than 7 days. In my test case I set that value to 5 minutes, not 7 days (I didn't want to wait for 7 days to test my code).</p>
     <p>You would want to use a similar small threshold period, for testing.</p>
     <p>Then, when you are happy it is all working, you can set the threshold to 7 days:</p>
     <pre><code>if (now - lastChecked &gt; 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) { // 7 days
  ...
}
</code></pre>
     <hr>
     <p><strong>Multiple checkboxes</strong></p>
     <p>When you are happy that one checkbox is working correctly, you can enhance the approach to cover multiple checkboxes.</p>
     <p>There are various different ways this could be done. Here is one which involves minimal code changes:</p>
     <p>Step 1: Create a new global variable:</p>
     <pre><code>var checkboxes = [ 'C15', 'C16' ];
</code></pre>
     <p>This is placed outside of any existing functions (it is not inside its own function, either).</p>
     <p>Step 2: Change the <code>onEdit()</code> function:</p>
     <p>Replace this:</p>
     <pre><code>&amp;&amp; rangeA1 === 'B14'
</code></pre>
     <p>with this:</p>
     <pre><code>&amp;&amp; checkboxes.includes(rangeA1)
</code></pre>
     <p>This simply checks to see if the edited cell is one of your checkbox cells.</p>
     <p>Step 3: In <code>resetCheckbox()</code>, wrap the checking code in a loop:</p>
     <pre><code>checkboxes.forEach((checkbox) =&gt; { // the new loop
  var range = mySheet.getRange(checkbox); // no hard-coded cell address!
  var note = range.getNote().split(':');
  if (range.getValue() &amp;&amp; note.length &gt; 1) {
    var lastChecked = note[1];
    var now = new Date().getTime();
    if (now - lastChecked &gt; 5 * 60 * 1000) {
      range.uncheck();
    }
  }
} ) // end of the new loop
</code></pre>
     <p>This iterates over each checkbox cell address. Note how we no longer need to use a hard-coded cell reference - now we have <code>mySheet.getRange(checkbox);</code> instead.</p>
