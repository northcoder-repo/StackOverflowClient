    </div>
   </div>
   <div>
    <p>When an application is started via main method in Java and it spins other user threads(not daemon) for tasks such as :</p>
    <ul>
     <li>User Thread-01 : Loading Cache From Database</li>
     <li>User Thread-02 : Perform application startup tasks like running diagnostics</li>
     <li>User Thread-03 : Miscellaneous tasks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The user threads started by main thread will complete execution at some point in time and terminate. This will cause the main thread to terminate eventually and the application will stop running. But, as we see so many applications which once started keep on running and if we take a thread dump, we can see the main thread at the very bottom. This means the main thread is not terminated which means the user threads started are not terminated.</p>
    <p>How is this achieved ? I mean what are standard programming constructs and logics to keep threads alive without running them through an infinite for or while loop ?</p>
    <p>Thanks for going through the question. Every helpful reply will add to our knowledge.</p>

     <h1>Executors framework</h1>
     <p>You said:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>spins other user threads</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>Hopefully you are not addressing <code>Thread</code> objects directly. Since Java 5, for most purposes we can be using the Executors framework to manage work on background threads. See <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/executors.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorial</a> by Oracle.</p>
     <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>ExecutorService es = Executors. … ;
es.submit( yourRunnableOrCallableHere ) ;  // Optional: Capture the returned `Future` object to track success/failure of your task.
…
es.shutdown() ;
</code></pre>
     <h2>Background threads ending has no effect on main thread</h2>
     <p>You said:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>The user threads started by main thread will complete execution at some point in time and terminate. This will cause the main thread to terminate eventually and the application will stop running.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>Not correct.</p>
     <p>The main thread ends when it has no more work to do. Background threads may end before the main thread, or after the main thread. The background threads termination does <em>not</em> cause the main thread to end.</p>
     <p>Here is some example code to demonstrate this behavior. This app performs a thread-dump and then runs a task in the background which also performs a thread dump. Both main thread and background thread sleep a few seconds.</p>
     <pre><code>package work.basil.example;

        System.out.println( "Bonjour. " + Instant.now() );
        System.out.println( Threading.threadDump( true , true ) );

        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
        executorService.submit(
                ( ) -&gt; {
                    System.out.println( "---------------|  background thread  |------------------------------------" );

                    System.out.println( Threading.threadDump( true , true ) );
                    System.out.println( "DEBUG - Ending background thread. " + Instant.now() );
                }
        );

        executorService.shutdown();  // Always be sure to shutdown  your executor services.
        try {Thread.sleep( Duration.ofSeconds( 5 ).toMillis() );} catch ( InterruptedException e ) {e.printStackTrace();}
        System.out.println( "---------------|  main thread  |------------------------------------" );

    // `threadDump` method taken from: https://www.baeldung.com/java-thread-dump
    private static String threadDump ( boolean lockedMonitors , boolean lockedSynchronizers )
    {
        StringBuffer threadDump = new StringBuffer( System.lineSeparator() );
        ThreadMXBean threadMXBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();
        for ( ThreadInfo threadInfo : threadMXBean.dumpAllThreads( lockedMonitors , lockedSynchronizers ) )
        {
            String message = "Thread: " + threadInfo.getThreadId() + " | " + threadInfo.getThreadName();

//            threadDump.append( threadInfo.toString() );
        }
        return threadDump.toString();
    }
}
</code></pre>
     <p>When we sleep the background thread for less time than the main thread (2 seconds versus 5), notice that the main thread continues. The background thread ending has no effect on the main thread continuing or ending.</p>
     <p>When run, notice how launching the executor service with a submitted task results in two more threads with IDs 14 &amp; 15 here. Then after the background task ends and the executor service is closed, the thread with ID 14 disappears. Notice how the main thread <em>does not end</em>, continuing to do work —&nbsp;contradicting your statement in the Question.</p>

     </blockquote>
     <p>Regarding "we have a website which is alive even when no one is opening the web page in the browser", no your web site is not "alive". Without any pending HTTP request to handle, your Java Servlet is <em>not</em> executing. Your servlet is loaded and initialized, but is <em>not</em> executing until a request arrives.</p>
     <p>Regarding "which means the application is running even when no one is interacting with it", no your web app is not running, as I said above. Your Java servlet code is not executing. When a request arrives, the web container automatically invokes your servlet's code in a thread. Ultimately that servlet code results in the generation of content sent back to the web browser in a response. Your servlet code's execution ends. The thread used for that execution either ends or is returned to a thread pool (an internal decision for your web container to make). I am ignoring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Push technology</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket" rel="nofollow noreferrer">WebSockets</a> for the sake of simplicity.</p>
     <p>Regarding: "if we say that it is the web server which is running in background and not the actual web application", the web server is always running an extra thread to listen for incoming requests.</p>
     <p>➥ This may be the root of your confusion: <em><strong>A web server is always busy</strong></em>, busy listening for incoming connections, whether or not executing your Java servlet code.</p>
     <ul>
      <li>A web server has one thread dedicated to working with the host OS to listen on the network for incoming connections.</li>
      <li>A web server launches <em>other</em> threads as needed to respond to a request by formulating and sending a response.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Regarding: "how is the web application is running indefinitely even when no one is interacting with it", you are forgetting that the host OS is interacting with the web container, whether or not users are interacting with your web app. The web container maintains a thread listening for incoming connections. That thread sits blocked, waiting on a notification by the host operating system's networking stack of an incoming request. (My description here is generalized and simplified — I'm no networking expert — but suffices for the point being made here.)</p>
     <p>When a request comes in over the network, the host OS informs the web container. This notification unblocks the listening thread. The listening thread dispatches the request to a new thread, resulting in your Java servlet's code executing. Meanwhile the request-listening thread of the web container goes back to being blocked to await another notification from the host OS’ network stack about yet another incoming request.</p>
     <p>That blocked listening thread is what explains/enables the web server running continuously and indefinitely. Your web app, in contrast, runs in spurts, only in response to a request.</p>
     <p>Your question is a credit to the genius and success of Java Servlet technology. The very purpose of Java Servlet is to abstract away all these details about listening for network activity, translating packets to text to decipher a request, parsing that request, mapping the request's contents to being the responsibility of a particular servlet, ensuring that particular servlet is loaded and initialized, and eventually calling a specific method in your servlet code defined by the Servlet spec.</p>
     <h1>A user app is busy waiting for input, all the time</h1>
     <p>Similar to a web server being always busy listening for incoming requests, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Console_application" rel="nofollow noreferrer">console apps</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface" rel="nofollow noreferrer">gui apps</a> are both always busy listening for user input. They may seem idle at times, but are not.</p>
     <p>While user apps do not spin continuously on the CPU, they do maintain a thread that works with the host OS to be informed of user events such as keyboard typing and mouse motion/clicks.</p>
