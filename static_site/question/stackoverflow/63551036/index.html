    <p>I have a utilities file named <code>utilities.java</code> that is located in my <code>...\NetbeansProjects\Utilities</code> folder and I want to use the methods in it in any java project that I work on.</p>
    <p>If I right-click <code>Libraries</code> folder, there is an option to include <code>JAR/folder...</code> so I select that and find and select the <code>Utilities</code> folder and Absolute Path to it as shown, which adds the <code>Utilities</code> folder to the <code>Libraries</code> folder, as shown.</p>
    <p>But how do I reference the methods that are in <code>Utilities.java</code>?</p>
    <p><code>import</code> doesn't offer any help and all I get on every attempted reference is <code>Cannot find symbol</code>.</p>
    <p>I can't turn <code>Utilities.java</code> into a <code>.jar</code> file (can I??) because the option to <code>Compile</code> is grayed out.</p>
    <p>What do I prefix to each such unresolved external reference to successfully link such methods to my code?</p>
    <p>Whether I try to just <code>import</code> or <code>import static</code>, I get error, with suggestions to change to some inappropriate import.</p>
    <p>What's irritating is that I think I've successfully done this before....</p>

     <p>Based on your screenshot, it looks like you are using an older version of NetBeans (perhaps v8.2 or similar). I will assume this - but it would be worth upgrading if possible.</p>
     <p>Generally, I would recommend creating two NetBeans projects, and then include the utilities project as a dependency in the application project.</p>
     <p>You can use the "Library" features of NetBeans (as shown in your screenshot) but I think it is cleaner to just create projects, which <em><strong>can then be managed by Git/Mercurial/etc. as needed, as separate projects</strong></em>, with no need to rely on NetBeans-specific library management features.</p>
     <p><strong>Ant-Based Approach</strong></p>
     <p>For an Ant-based approach (the default for NetBeans 8), that would be something like this:</p>
     <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CQybu.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="/question/stackoverflow/63551036/CQybu.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
     <p>The above was created as follows:</p>
     <p>Create the utilities project:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>File &gt; New Project &gt; Java &gt; <strong>Java Class Library</strong></li>
      <li>Project Name: MyUtilities</li>
      <li>Create your package and your Utilities.java file. Add the code you need.</li>
      <li>Clean and build the project.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Create a project to use the utility JAR:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>File &gt; New Project &gt; Java &gt; <strong>Java Application</strong></li>
      <li>Project Name: MyApplication</li>
      <li>Right-click on MyApplication in the project explorer and select the Properties pop-up window.</li>
      <li>Libraries &gt; Add Project - find the MyUtilities project and select it, click on "Add Project JAR Files".</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Now you will see that project's jar file listed as one of MyApplication's library dependencies.</p>
     <p>After cleaning and building the project you will see a file structure as follows:</p>

     <p><em>Note: For NetBeans 12, it's similar, except they now make the choice of an Ant project (vs. Maven, Gradle) explicit, rather than the default.</em></p>
     <p><strong>Maven-Based Approach</strong></p>
     <p>It's a similar approach: Two separate projects. In this case they are both "Maven &gt; Java Application" projects - there is no distinction, in contrast to the Ant approach.</p>
     <p>The main difference is how you include the utilities JAR in your applications. that depends on how you want to manage your Maven artifacts - and is a bit outside the scope of this question. One way is to follow the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-3rd-party-jars-local.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">guidelines here</a> - but I think there are other approaches, also.</p>
