    <p>I have a method for getting users from a database with JDBC:</p>
    <pre><code>public List&lt;User&gt; getUser(int userId) {
    String sql = "SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id = ?";
    List&lt;User&gt; users = new ArrayList&lt;User&gt;();
    try {
        Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(myConnectionURL);
        PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement(sql); 
        ps.setInt(1, userId);
        ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
        while(rs.next()) {
            users.add(new User(rs.getInt("id"), rs.getString("name")));
        }
        rs.close();
        ps.close();
        con.close();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return users;
}
</code></pre>
    <p>How should I use Java 7 <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html" rel="noreferrer"><strong>try-with-resources</strong></a> to improve this code?</p>
    <p>I have tried with the code below, but it uses many <code>try</code> blocks, and doesn't improve the <strong>readability</strong> much. Should I use <code>try-with-resources</code> in another way?</p>
    <pre><code>public List&lt;User&gt; getUser(int userId) {
    String sql = "SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id = ?";
    List&lt;User&gt; users = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    try {
        try (Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(myConnectionURL);
             PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement(sql);) {
            ps.setInt(1, userId);

     <p>There's no need for the outer try in your example, so you can at least go down from 3 to 2, and also you don't need closing <code>;</code> at the end of the resource list. The advantage of using two try blocks is that all of your code is present up front so you don't have to refer to a separate method:</p>
     <pre><code>public List&lt;User&gt; getUser(int userId) {
    String sql = "SELECT id, username FROM users WHERE id = ?";
    List&lt;User&gt; users = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    try (Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(myConnectionURL);
         PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        ps.setInt(1, userId);
        try (ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery()) {

     <p>As others have stated, your code is basically correct though the outer <code>try</code> is unneeded. Here are a few more thoughts.</p>
     <h1><code>DataSource</code></h1>
     <p>Other answers here are correct and good, such the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8066594/642706">accepted Answer</a> by bpgergo. But none of them show the use of <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.sql/javax/sql/DataSource.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>DataSource</code></a>, commonly recommended over use of <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.sql/java/sql/DriverManager.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>DriverManager</code></a> in modern Java.</p>
     <p>So for the sake of completeness, here is a complete example that fetches the current date from the database server. The database used here is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Postgres</a>. Any other database would work similarly. You would replace the use of <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/publicapi/org/postgresql/ds/PGSimpleDataSource.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource</code></a> with an implementation of <code>DataSource</code> appropriate to your database. An implementation is likely provided by your particular driver, or connection pool if you go that route.</p>
     <p>A <code>DataSource</code> implementation need <em>not</em> be closed, because it is never “opened”. A <code>DataSource</code> is not a resource, is not connected to the database, so it is not holding networking connections nor resources on the database server. A <code>DataSource</code> is simply information needed when making a connection to the database, with the database server's network name or address, the user name, user password, and various options you want specified when a connection is eventually made. So your <code>DataSource</code> implementation object does <em>not</em> go inside your try-with-resources parentheses.</p>
     <p>The purpose of <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.sql/javax/sql/DataSource.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>DataSource</code></a> is to externalize your database connection information. If you hard-code username, password, and such within your your source code, then a change to your database server configuration means having to recompile and redeploy your code — not fun. Instead, such database configuration details should be stored <em>outside</em> your source code, then retrieved at runtime. You can retrieve the configuration details via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Naming_and_Directory_Interface" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JNDI</a> from a naming and directory server such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LDAP</a>. Or you might retrieve from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_container" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Servlet container</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_EE" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Jakarta EE</a> server running your app.</p>
     <h1>Nested try-with-resources</h1>
     <p>Your code makes proper use of nested try-with-resources statements.</p>
     <p>Notice in the example code below that we also use the try-with-resources syntax <em>twice</em>, one nested inside the other. The outer <code>try</code> defines two resources: <code>Connection</code> and <code>PreparedStatement</code>. The inner <code>try</code> defines the <code>ResultSet</code> resource. This is a common code structure.</p>
     <p>If an exception is thrown from the inner one, and not caught there, the <code>ResultSet</code> resource will automatically be closed (if it exists, is not null). Following that, the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.sql/java/sql/PreparedStatement.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>PreparedStatement</code></a> will be closed, and lastly the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/jdk.jdi/com/sun/jdi/connect/spi/Connection.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Connection</code></a> is closed. Resources are automatically closed in reverse order in which they were declared within the try-with-resource statements.</p>
     <p>The example code here is overly simplistic. As written, it could be executed with a single try-with-resources statement. But in a real work you will likely be doing more work between the nested pair of <code>try</code> calls. For example, you may be extracting values from your user-interface or a POJO, and then passing those to fulfill <code>?</code> placeholders within your SQL via calls to <code>PreparedStatement::set…</code> methods.</p>
     <h1>Syntax notes</h1>
     <h2>Trailing semicolon</h2>
     <p>Notice that the semicolon trailing the last resource statement within the parentheses of the try-with-resources is optional. I include it in my own work for two reasons: Consistency and it looks complete, and it makes copy-pasting a mix of lines easier without having to worry about end-of-line semicolons. Your IDE may flag the last semicolon as superfluous, but there is no harm in leaving it.</p>
     <h2>Java 9 – Use existing vars in try-with-resources</h2>
     <p><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/whatsnew/toc.htm#JSNEW-GUID-825576B5-203C-4C8D-85E5-FFDA4CA0B346" rel="nofollow noreferrer">New in Java 9</a> is an enhancement to try-with-resources syntax. We can now declare and populate the resources outside the parentheses of the <code>try</code> statement. I have not yet found this useful for JDBC resources, but keep it in mind in your own work.</p>
     <h2><code>ResultSet</code> should close itself, but may not</h2>
     <p>In an ideal world the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.sql/java/sql/ResultSet.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ResultSet</code></a> would close itself as the documentation promises:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>A ResultSet object is automatically closed when the Statement object that generated it is closed, re-executed, or used to retrieve the next result from a sequence of multiple results.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>Unfortunately, in the past some JDBC drivers infamously failed to fulfill this promise. As a result, many JDBC programmers learned to explicitly close all their JDBC resources including <code>Connection</code>, <code>PreparedStatement</code>, and <code>ResultSet</code> too. The modern try-with-resources syntax has made doing so easier, and with more compact code. Notice that the Java team went to the bother of marking <code>ResultSet</code> as <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/AutoCloseable.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>AutoCloseable</code></a>, and I suggest we make use of that. Using a try-with-resources around all your JDBC resources makes your code more self-documenting as to your intentions.</p>

        <td><span>Thank you. My question was because you don't need to declare a catch for a try with resources and it will execute an implicit finally, which means, this try has its own particularities. In my head, it could be ignoring the exception because there was no catch but there was a finally (which usually happens after catches).

     <p>What about creating an additional wrapper class?<br></p>
     <pre><code>package com.naveen.research.sql;

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public abstract class PreparedStatementWrapper implements AutoCloseable {

    protected PreparedStatement stat;

    public PreparedStatementWrapper(Connection con, String query, Object ... params) throws SQLException {
        this.stat = con.prepareStatement(query);
        this.prepareStatement(params);
    }

    protected abstract void prepareStatement(Object ... params) throws SQLException;

    public ResultSet executeQuery() throws SQLException {
        return this.stat.executeQuery();
    }

    public int executeUpdate() throws SQLException {
        return this.stat.executeUpdate();
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        try {
            this.stat.close();
        } catch (SQLException e) {

                stat.setLong(1, Long.class.cast(params[0]));
                stat.setString(2, String.valueOf(params[1]));
