   <div>
    <p>How can I use an unsupported Locale (eg. <code>ar-US</code>) in <strong>JAVA 11</strong> when I output a number via <code>String.format()</code>?</p>
    <p>In <strong>Java 8</strong> this worked just fine (try <a href="https://jdoodle.com/ia/5xj" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jdoodle</a>, <em>select JDK 1.8.0_66</em>):</p>
    <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>Locale locale = Locale.forLanguageTag("ar-US");
System.out.println(String.format(locale, "Output: %d", 120));
// Output: 120
</code></pre>
    <p>Since <strong>Java 11</strong> the output is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Arabic_numerals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Eastern Arabic numerals</a> (try <a href="https://jdoodle.com/ia/5xj" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jdoodle</a>, <em>use default JDK 11.0.4</em>):</p>
    <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>Locale locale = Locale.forLanguageTag("ar-US");
System.out.println(String.format(locale, "Output: %d", 120));
// Output: ١٢٠
</code></pre>
    <p>It seems, this problem comes from the switch in the <strong>Locale Data Providers</strong> form <strong>JRE</strong> to <strong><a href="http://cldr.unicode.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CLDR</a></strong> (source: <a href="https://link.medium.com/cCfPBXOR4bb" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Localization Changes in Java 9 by @mcarth</a>). Here is a list of supported locales: <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-suported-locales.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JDK 11 Supported Locales</a></p>
    <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
    <p>I updated the questions example to <code>ar-US</code>, as my example before didn't make sense. The idea is to have a format which makes sense in that given country. In the example it would be the United States (<code>US</code>).</p>

     <p>The behavior conforms to the CLDR being treated as the preferred <code>Locale</code>. To confirm this, the same snippet in Java-8 could be executed with</p>
     <pre><code>-Djava.locale.providers=CLDR
</code></pre>
     <p>If you step back to look at the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/252" rel="noreferrer">JEP 252: Use CLDR Locale Data by Default</a>, the details follow :</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>The default lookup order will be CLDR, COMPAT, SPI, where COMPAT designates the JRE's locale data in JDK 9. If a particular provider cannot offer the requested locale data, the search will proceed to the next provider in order.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>So, in short if you really don't want the default behaviour to be that of Java-11, you can change the order of lookup with the VM argument</p>
     <pre><code>-Djava.locale.providers=COMPAT,CLDR,SPI
</code></pre>
     <p>What might help further is understanding more about <a href="http://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/picking-the-right-language-code" rel="noreferrer">picking the right language using CLDR!</a></p>

If you use <code>ar_DZ</code> it should format as <code>120</code> due to local preference. There’s some discussion about what the default should be (such as for <code>ar_US</code> where there is not currently data) but at present the default is Arabic digits. Is your concern whether <code>١٢٠</code> is right for US specifically or something else?Thanks!</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Steven R.

     <p>I'm sure I'm missing some nuance, but the problem is with your tag, so fix that. Specifically:</p>
     <p><code>ar-EN</code> makes no sense. That's short for:</p>
     <pre><code>language = arabic
country = ?? nobody knows.
</code></pre>
     <p>EN is not a country. <code>en</code> is certainly a language code (for english), but the second part in a language tag is for country, and EN is not a country. (for context, there is <code>en-GB</code> for british english and <code>en-US</code> for american english).</p>
     <p>Thus, this is as good as <code>ar</code> (as in, language = arabic, not tied to any particular country). Even if you did tie it to some country, that is mostly immaterial here; that would affect things like 'what is the first day of the week' ,'which currency symbol is to be presumed' and 'should temperatures be stated in Kelvin or Fahrenheit' perhaps. It has no bearing on how to show digits, because that's all based on language.</p>
     <p>And language is arabic, thus, ١٢٠ is what you get when you try <code>ar</code> as a language tag when printing the number 120. The problem is that you expect this to return <code>"120"</code> which is a bizarre wish<sup>1</sup>, combined with the fact that java, unfortunately, shipped with a bug for a long long time that made it act in this bizarre fashion, thinking that rendering the number 120 in arabic is best done with <code>"120"</code>, which is wrong.</p>
     <p>So, with that context, in order of preference:</p>
     <h2>Best solution</h2>
     <p>Find out why your system ends up with ar-EN and nevertheless expects '120', and fix this. Also fix ar-EN in general; EN is not a country.</p>
     <p>More generally, 'unsupported locale' isn't really a thing. the <code>ar</code> part is supported, and it's the only relevant part of the tag for rendering digits.</p>
     <h2>Alternatives</h2>
     <p>The most likely best answer if the above is not possible is to explicitly work around it. Detect the tag yourself, and write code that will just respond with the result of formatting this number using <code>Locale.ENGLISH</code> instead, guaranteeing that you get <code>Output: 120</code>. The rest seems considerably worse: You could try to write a localization provider which is a ton of work, or you can try to tell java to use the JRE version of the provider, but that one is obsoleted and will not be updated, so you're kicking the can down the road and setting yourself up for a maintenance burden later.</p>
     <p><sup>1.)</sup> Given that the JRE variant actually printed 120, and you're also indicating you want this, I get that nagging feeling I'm missing some political or historical info and the expectation that <code>ar-EN</code> results in rendering the number 120 as <code>"120"</code> is not so crazy. I'd love to hear that story if you care to provide it!</p>
