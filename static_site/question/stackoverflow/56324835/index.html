   <div>
    <p>Lately I encountered a method defined similar to this and I don't exactly understand its usage:</p>
    <pre><code>public static &lt;T, U extends T&gt; T foo(U u) { ... }
</code></pre>
    <p>A sample use could be like this:</p>
    <pre><code>// Baz is just the containing class of foo()
Number n = Baz.foo(1);
</code></pre>
    <p>Where <code>T</code> is inferred to <code>Number</code> and <code>U</code> (probably) to <code>Integer</code>. But I can't wrap my head around when this is superior to e.g. this method definition:</p>
    <pre><code>public static &lt;T&gt; T bar(T t) { ... }
</code></pre>
    <p>If I call it like this:</p>
    <pre><code>Number n = Baz.bar(2);
</code></pre>
    <p>The code still works. <code>T</code> is inferred to either <code>Number</code> or <code>Integer</code> (Don't know if the argument type, in this example <code>Integer</code> is preferred over the call site return type <code>Number</code>)</p>
    <p>I've read these questions: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39984548/generics-parameter-extends-another-parameter-on-java-method">1</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15491058/meaning-of-t-u-extends-t-in-java-function-declaration">2</a> but I still don't know if the first method with 2 parameters has any advantage over the second method with only one generic.</p>

     <p>I think that, in fact, this <em>only</em> makes sense when the type parameter of the method appears as the type parameter of a parameterized type that is part of the method signature.</p>
     <p><sup>(At least, I couldn't quickly come up with an example where it would <em>really</em> makes sense otherwise)</sup></p>
     <p>This is also the case in the question that you linked to, where the method type parameters are used as type parameters in the <code>AutoBean</code> class.</p>
     <hr>
     <p><sub>A small update:</sub></p>
     <p>Based on the discussion in the question and other answers, the core of this question was likely a misinterpretation of the way of how the type parameters are used. As such, this question could be considered as a duplicate of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15491058/meaning-of-t-u-extends-t-in-java-function-declaration">Meaning of &lt;T, U extends T&gt; in java function declaration</a> , but hopefully someone will consider this answer helpful nevertheless.</p>
     <p>In the end, the reason for using the pattern of <code>&lt;T, U extends T&gt;</code> can be seen in the inheritance relationships of parameterized types, which in detail may be <a href="http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/FAQSections/TechnicalDetails.html#FAQ207" rel="noreferrer">fairly complicated</a>. As an example, to illustrate the most relevant point: A <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> is <strong>not</strong> a subtype of a <code>List&lt;Number&gt;</code>.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>An example showing where it can make a difference is below. It contains a "trivial" implementation that always works (and does not make sense, as far as I can tell). But the type bound becomes relevant when the type parameters <code>T</code> and <code>U</code> are also the type parameters of the method parameters and return type. Whith the <code>T extends U</code>, you can return a type that has a supertype as the type parameter. Otherwise, you couldn't, as shown with the example that <code>// Does not work</code>:</p>
     <pre><code>import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class SupertypeMethod {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Integer integer = null;
        Number number = null;

        List&lt;Number&gt; numberList = null;
        List&lt;Integer&gt; integerList = null;

        // Always works:
        integer = fooTrivial(integer);
        number = fooTrivial(number);
        number = fooTrivial(integer);

        numberList = withList(numberList);
        //numberList = withList(integerList); // Does not work

        // Both work:
        numberList = withListAndBound(numberList);
        numberList = withListAndBound(integerList);
    }

    public static &lt;T, U extends T&gt; T fooTrivial(U u) {
        return u;
    }

    public static &lt;T, U extends T&gt; List&lt;T&gt; withListAndBound(List&lt;U&gt; u) {
        List&lt;T&gt; result = new ArrayList&lt;T&gt;();
        result.add(u.get(0));
        return result;
    }

    public static &lt;T&gt; List&lt;T&gt; withList(List&lt;T&gt; u) {
        List&lt;T&gt; result = new ArrayList&lt;T&gt;();
        result.add(u.get(0));
        return result;
    }

}

     <p>This is handy when you want to return a super type; exactly like you showed in your example.</p>
     <p>You take a <code>U</code> as input and return a <code>T</code> - which is a super-type of <code>U</code>; the other way around to declare this would be <code>T super U</code> - but this is not legal in java.</p>
     <p>This should be an example of what I mean actually. Suppose a very simple class like:</p>
     <pre><code>static class Holder&lt;T&gt; {

    private final T t;

    public Holder(T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    public &lt;U super T&gt; U whenNull(U whenNull){
        return t == null ? whenNull : t;
    }
}
</code></pre>
     <p>Method <code>whenNull</code> as it is defined would not compile, as <code>U super T</code> is not allowed in java.</p>
     <p>Instead you could add another type parameter and invert the types:</p>
     <pre><code>static class Holder&lt;U, T extends U&gt; {

    private final T t;

    public Holder(T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    public U whenNull(U whenNull) {
        return t == null ? whenNull : t;
    }
}
</code></pre>
     <p>And usage would be:</p>
     <pre><code>Holder&lt;Number, Integer&gt; n = new Holder&lt;&gt;(null);
Number num = n.whenNull(22D);
</code></pre>
     <p>this allows to return a super type; but it looks very weird. We have added another type in the class declaration.</p>
     <p>We could resort to:</p>
     <pre><code>static class Holder&lt;T&gt; {

    private final T t;

    public Holder(T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    public static &lt;U, T extends U&gt; U whenNull(U whenNull, Holder&lt;T&gt; holder) {
        return holder.t == null ? whenNull : holder.t;
    }
}
</code></pre>
     <p>or even make this method static.</p>
     <p>For an existing limitation, you could try to do:</p>
     <pre><code>Optional.ofNullable(&lt;SomeSubTypeThatIsNull&gt;)
        .orElse(&lt;SomeSuperType&gt;)
</code></pre>

     <p>My first thought was: heck,</p>
     <pre><code>Number n = Baz.bar(2);
</code></pre>
     <p>would "always" work, as Integer extends Number. So there is no advantage of doing that. But what if you had a super class that wasn't abstract?!</p>
     <p>Then the <code>U extends T</code> allows you to return an object that is <strong>only</strong> of the supertype class, but <strong>not</strong> of the child class!</p>
     <p>Something like</p>
     <pre><code>class B { } 
class C extends B { }
</code></pre>
     <p>now that generic method can return an instance of B, too. If there is just a T ... then the method can only return instances of C.</p>
     <p>In other words: the <code>U extends T</code> allows you to return instances of B <strong>and</strong> C. <code>T</code> alone: only C!</p>
     <p>But of course, the above makes sense when you look at some specific B and C. But when a method is (in reality) simply returning an instance of B, why would one need generics here in the first place?!</p>
     <p>So, I concur with the question: I can't see the <em>practical</em> value of this construct either. Unless one gets into reflection, but even then I don't see a sound design that could <em>only</em> work because of <code>U extends T</code>.</p>

Parameterized classes, like <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>List&lt;U&gt;</code>, are a whole different chapter though and there are some cases where this construct makes sense.</span> <span> - </span> <span class="display-name">Lino</span> <span> </span> <span class="date">27 May 2019 at 12:07</span></td>

You would need to add another type to be able to do that, via : <code>static class Holder&lt;T, U extends T&gt; {... }</code>, but this adds another type parameter...

     <p>The first method</p>
     <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public static &lt;T, U extends T&gt; T foo(U u) { ... }
</code></pre>
     <p>means that <code>T</code> and <code>U</code> can be different types. I.e. one type <code>T</code> and one type <code>U</code> that is a sub-type of <code>T</code>.</p>
     <p>With your second example</p>
     <pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public static &lt;T&gt; T bar(T t) { ... }
</code></pre>
     <p><code>bar(T t)</code> <strong>must</strong> return the same type as argument <code>t</code> is. It can not return an object of a type that is a super-class to the argument type. That would only be possible with your first variant.</p>
