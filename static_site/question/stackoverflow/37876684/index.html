    <p>From the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/connecting.html#drivermanager" rel="noreferrer">Java documentation</a></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>In previous versions of JDBC, to obtain a connection, you first had to initialize your JDBC driver by calling the method Class.forName.</p>
     <p>Any JDBC 4.0 drivers that are found in your class path are automatically loaded. (However, you must manually load any drivers prior to JDBC 4.0 with the method Class.forName.)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I have a jersey Webservice which connects to SQL Server Express 2016. It has sqljdbc42.jar which is 4.2 driver, in the CLASSPATH</p>
    <p>However, if I omit the <code>Class.forName("com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver")</code> call, my <code>DriverManager.getConnection</code> throws a <code>SQLException</code>(No suitable driver found for jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433; ....")</p>
    <p>The <code>getConnection</code> starts succeeding once I add the <code>Class.forName</code> call.</p>
    <p>I am on Java 8.</p>
    <p>What am I missing?</p>
    <p>UPDATE: I just tried a command line program and it works without the <code>forName</code>. However, from my Eclipse IDE where I am running my REST service as a Tomcat 8.0 Server on localhost, it doesn't work.</p>

     <p>The drivers are automatically initialized when the class <em>DriverManager</em> is itself initialized thanks to <em>SPI</em> (Service Provider Interface). Which means that internally it will try to find any file <code>META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver</code> available in the context class loader and for each file found, it will create an instance of the class that is defined in the file which in this case is actually the FQN of the <em>JDBC</em> driver, this is how <em>JDBC</em> drivers are automatically initialized starting from <em>JDBC 4.0</em>.</p>
     <p>But this can only work, if your driver is available from the context class loader while initializing the class <em>DriverManager</em>. A good way to ensure that is to make your driver available from a <em>Class Loader</em> high enough in the hierarchy. In your case you should put your driver in <code>tomcat/lib</code>. Indeed, this way your driver will be available from the <em>Common CL</em> which should be high enough. More details about the CL hierarchy in Tomcat <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/class-loader-howto.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
